### By: Ayan Das, Adeeb Ahmed, Nasif Rahman

<p><b>Purpose:</b> This project contains two features. The first part of the project involves implementing a function that will analyze a text file and output in the form of a dictionary the words and the frequency at which they appear throughout the text. The keys being the unique words itself and the associated values representing the integer value, which indicates the number of times the associated word appear throughout the text.</p>

<br>

<p>For our source of data, we used the website: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/69079, this link contains the source where the text file was downloaded. It was an ebook and had various download options, so we went with the text file option since that was the requirement of the project prompt. Prior to running the function "wordFrequency", we needed to retrieve the text file from our storage and convert it into a string, removing any line breaks and splits so we can traverse the string. We also needed a dictionary to serve as a container for the word frequency.</p>
