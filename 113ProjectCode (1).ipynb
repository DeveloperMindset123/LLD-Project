It alone amongst the English counties was forcenturies ruled by Sovereign Bishops possessing their own peers, troops,mint, and legal courts. In every respect it was a miniature kingdom, inits constitution like only to the well-known Prince-Bishoprics of theContinent.In the past the county has been favoured by a succession of historians,who have dealt more or less fully with its parochial history. Morerecently Dr. Lapsley and the contributors to the \"Victoria History\" haveminutely examined the various phases of its early constitution. In thepublications of the local archæological societies, the greater mansionsand most of the more interesting churches have been dealt with indetail.In view, therefore, of the now considerable accumulated literature uponthe county, it has been a matter of no small difficulty to selectsubjects which should be helpful to the scholar as well as interestingto the general reader.It has been endeavoured to make this volume serve a twofold purpose.Firstly, to awaken a greater interest in the past of this most historicdistrict, and secondly, to serve as an introduction to the greaterhistories of the county. Some day, perhaps, we may hope to see anedition of Surtees’, revised to a recent date, and covering thoseportions of the county which he did not live to deal with.Through the courtesy of the Earl of Durham we are enabled to reproducefor the first time the portrait of William James, sometime Bishop ofDurham. Lord Strathmore has kindly enabled us to include the veryinteresting photograph of Streatlam Castle. Thanks are also due to Mrs.Greenwell, of Greenwell Ford, for the photograph of Fen Hall. Mr. J.Tavenor-Perry has supplied the sketches of the cathedral sanctuaryknocker and the dun cow panel, besides the valuable measured drawings ofFinchale Priory. The remaining sketches in pen and ink have beencontributed by Mr. Wilfrid Leighton.In conclusion, in addition to thanking the contributors of the variouschapters for the care with which they have treated their subjects,thanks are due to the Rev. William Greenwell and to the Rev. Dr. Gee,who have both made useful suggestions.CONTENTS                                                                    PAGEHistorical Introduction                By the Rev.

HENRY GEE, D.D., F.S.A., MASTER OF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE,DURHAMIn the older maps of England, that portion of the country which we callthe county of Durham is generally described as \"EpiscopatusDunelmensis,\" or the Bishopric of Durham, or simply the Bishopric. Afurther glance at the adjacent districts of Northumberland and Yorkshireshows that there are portions larger or smaller of those counties whichare marked as integral parts of Durham. These members of the Bishopricare Norhamshire, Islandshire, and Bedlingtonshire in Northumberland,with the Manors of Northallerton, Howden, and Crayke, and certain landsadjacent to them in Yorkshire. These portions of the Bishopric were onlycut off from it and merged in their own surrounding counties within thememory of persons still living. Indeed, the distinction betweenBishopric folk and County folk--that is to say, people of Durham andpeople of Northumberland--is not yet quite forgotten, and looks back toa very interesting piece of English history that has to do with a stateof things in the North of England which has now passed away.Visitors who come to the city of Durham to-day and look on cathedral andcastle have some vague idea of a time when the Bishop of Durham had \"thepower of life and death,\" as it is popularly called; but what thismeans, and what the peculiar constitution of the neighbourhood was, theydo not, as a rule, understand. It may be worth while to try and get aclearer view of the Bishopric of Durham, and more especially of themain portion between Tyne and Tees, which forms the modern county. Weto-day are so much accustomed to a strong central Government controllingthe whole of England, that we find it hard to think of a time whencertain districts had a large independence, and were ruled by a localEarl or by Bishop, rather than by the King in the capital. Yet therewere such times both in England and upon the Continent. The district soruled is known as a franchise or liberty, and the history of itsindependence, won, maintained, or lost, generally forms an attractivesubject of study, with many exciting episodes in it. The assertion iscertainly true of Durham; and although it is not possible to go intodetail within the space of an introductory article like this, it may bepossible to explain what the Bishopric was, and how it came to get itsdistinctive characteristics and its later modification.The franchise of the Bishop of Durham may be most aptly understood if wetry to regard all the members of it mentioned above as a little kingdom,of which Durham City was the capital. The Bishop of Durham was virtuallythe King of this little realm, and ruled it, not only as its spiritualhead, but as its temporal head. As its spiritual head, he was in theposition of any ordinary Bishop, and possessed exactly the same powersas other prelates. As its temporal head, he had a power which theygenerally did not possess. Dr. Freeman has explained his position in thefollowing words: \"The prelate of Durham became one and the moreimportant of the only two English prelates whose worldly franchisesinvested them with some faint shadow of the sovereign powers enjoyed bythe princely Churchmen of the Empire. The Bishop of Ely in his island,the Bishop of Durham in his hill-fortress, possessed powers which noother English ecclesiastic was allowed to share.... The external aspectof the city of itself suggests its peculiar character. Durham aloneamong English cities, with its highest point crowned, not only by thecathedral, but by the vast castle of the Prince-Bishop, recalls to mindthose cities of the Empire--Lausanne, or Chur, or Sitten--where thepriest, who bore alike the sword and the pastoral staff, looked downfrom his fortified height on a flock which he had to guard no lessagainst worldly than against ghostly foes.\"[1] And this sovereignty wasno nominal thing, for the Bishop came to have most of the institutionsthat we connect with the thought of a kingdom. He had his own courts oflaw, his own officers of state, his own assemblies, his own system offinance, his own coinage, and, to some extent, he had his own troops andhis own ships. As we understand all this, we shall appreciate thesignificance of the lofty throne erected by Bishop Hatfield in DurhamCathedral. It was placed there in the flourishing days of the Bishop’spower, and is not merely the seat of a Bishop, but the throne of a King.So too, hard by, in the Bishop’s castle, as the chronicler tells us,there were two seats of royalty within the hall, one at either end. Nodoubt it was before the Bishop, sitting as Prince in one of these, thatthe great tenants of his franchise--the Barons of the Bishopric, as theywere actually called--did homage in respect of their lands. Perhaps,when he sat in the other from time to time as Bishop, his clergy andothers recognized his spiritual authority, or submitted themselves tohis \"godly admonitions.\"The county of Durham has been marked out by nature, more or lessdistinctly, as separate from the neighbouring counties. The Tees on thesouth, and the Tyne on the north, with the Derwent running from thewestern fells to the Tyne, sufficiently differentiate it. In whatfollows we will keep mainly to the district represented by the moderncounty, leaving out of view the members outside to which reference hasbeen made. Its history, until modern times, is largely ecclesiastical,owing to its peculiar constitution, in which the Bishop plays soimportant a part. It had, indeed, virtually no history until the Churchbecame the great civilizer in Northumbria. Its prehistoric remains arefew, if interesting. Its occupation by Brigantes, a Celtic tribe, is alarge fact with no details. In the days when Romans made the North ofBritain their own, there is still no history beyond the evidence ofRoman roads, with camps at Binchester, Lanchester, and Ebchester.Certainly no Roman Christian remains have been found as yet; but when inthe seventh century Christianity came to the Anglian invaders whosettled in these parts after the departure of the Romans, the history ofthe English people was born within the confines of the modern county.Bede, the first of English scholars and writers, compiled his history inthe monastery of Jarrow. He tells us all we know of the earliest DurhamChristians--of Benedict Biscop and of Hilda, who, with himself, are thefirst three historic personages in the district. In one pregnantsentence he tells us how churches were built in different places, howthe people flocked together to hear the Word, and how landed possessionswere given by royal munificence to found monasteries. These monasteriesbecame the centres of religion, civilization, and learning all overNorthumbria; and, in particular, the monasteries of Jarrow andWearmouth, twin foundations of Benedict Biscop, were the commencement ofeverything best worth having between Tyne and Tees.Thus religion, art, and literature, were born in Durham. In the lastyears of the eighth century a terrible calamity fell upon the widerprovince, of which Durham was only a part, when the Danes raidedLindisfarne, where had been the starting-point of the NorthumbrianChurch. When the mother was thus spoiled and laid desolate, thedaughters trembled for their safety, but they were left for awhile, notunassailed, yet not destroyed. In those days of disturbed peace furthergifts of land were made to the Church, and in these we trace largeslices of Durham handed over in the ninth century to the monks ofLindisfarne by those who had the power to give. And here we must noticethat the great treasure of the monastery at Lindisfarne was the body ofSt. Cuthbert, the great Northumbrian saint, to whom the endowments namedwere most solemnly dedicated. They formed the nucleus of theBishopric--the beginnings of the Patrimony of St. Cuthbert, which isonly another name for the Bishopric. Repeated invasion of the Danes atlast drove the monks out of Lindisfarne, and destroyed the Durhammonasteries of Jarrow and Wearmouth. The Lindisfarne monks left theirisland, and bore away for safety’s sake the body of St. Cuthbert, andafter various wanderings brought it back to rest within the fortifiedenclosure of Chester-le-Street, and so within the confines of Durham.Here the Danish conquerors confirmed previous gifts, and added others tothem, until the lands of St. Cuthbert increased very widely, whilstChester-le-Street became a centre of pilgrimage.For 113 years Chester-le-Street was the Christian metropolis of theNorth, until the final fury of the Danes began to fall upon Northumbria.In 995 another exodus began, and the clergy bore off the body to Ripon,returning a few months later when the tempest seemed to have abated.Many legends cluster round this return, but in any case the fact isclear that the Bishop and his company took up their abode, not atChester-le-Street, but on the rocky peninsula of Dun-holm, or Durham,which the River Wear nearly encircled. In this way the seat ofecclesiastical authority was changed for the second time, and DurhamCity now became the centre of the still-expanding Bishopric. Greatprestige gathered round the Saxon cathedral in which the shrine of thesaint was placed, for Kings and Princes vied with one another in doinghonour to it. So Canute, walking to the spot with bare feet, gave freshdonations of Durham land and confirmed what others had bestowed.But again dark days fell upon the North. To say nothing of Scottishencroachments upon the Bishopric, which were sustained in the eleventhcentury, the worst blow fell when the Norman Conquest took place. In nopart of England was a more determined patriotism opposed to William thanin Durham. Submission was nominal, and desperate efforts were made tokeep Northumbria as a separate kingdom by placing Edgar Atheling upon anEnglish throne in York. When the Conqueror made a Norman called Cuminhis Viceroy in these parts, the men of Durham rose and murdered himwithin their city. It was an act that William never forgave and neverforgot. He wrought such a deed of vengeance that the whole of thesmiling district from York to Durham was turned into a wilderness. Whenhe came to die he is represented to have said of this ruthless episode:\"I fell on the English of the Northern counties like a ravening lion. Icommanded their houses and corn, with all their tools and furniture, tobe burnt without distinction, and large herds of cattle and beasts ofburden to be butchered wherever they were found. It was thus I tookrevenge on multitudes of both sexes, by subjecting them to the calamityof a cruel famine; and by so doing, alas! became the barbarous murdererof many thousands, both young and old, of that fine race of people.\"William placed foreigners in most positions of importance. To the See ofDurham he appointed Walcher from Lorraine, and the new prelate came fromhis consecration at Winchester, escorted across the belt of depopulated,ravaged land, until he reached Durham. North of the Wear the Patrimonyof St. Cuthbert was as yet largely untouched, but the men of Durham hadno love for the foreigner, and no wish to regard him as their lord.Fortunately for him the Earl of Northumbria stood his friend, and builtfor him in 1072 the Norman castle overlooking[Illustration: Portrait and Signature]the Wear, which was destined to be the Bishop’s fortress for seven and ahalf centuries. Within that castle Walcher was safe, and, helped by theEarl, he ruled his recalcitrant flock, not always wisely, but with allhis power, until an insurrection which he strove to quell cost him hislife. He died, however, not as mere Bishop of Durham, but as Earl ofNorthumbria as well, for when Waltheof the Earl died, William appointedWalcher in his place. Thus in the hands of the first Bishop after theConquest was held the double authority of Bishop and of Earl. Whatevermay have been the powers of the prelate in the Bishopric until thistime, it is certain that from this point he claims a double authoritywithin the Patrimony of St. Cuthbert. As for Walcher, stern example wasmade of what resistance to the Bishop’s lawful authority would mean,when William laid waste the land that had escaped ten years before, andextended his ravages north of the Wear and towards the Tyne.Just before the eleventh century expired, an event of considerableimportance took place when Bishop Carileph began the great cathedralwhich still crowns the height above the Wear at Durham. About the sametime an understanding was reached between the Earl of Northumbria andthe Bishop, by which all the rights and the independence of theBishopric seem to have been recognized and confirmed, so thathenceforward the Bishop was the undisputed lord of the lands of St.Cuthbert.[2] When in 1104 the cathedral was sufficiently advanced toreceive the body of the saint within its eastern apse, a great ceremonytook place, which served to carry the prestige of Durham beyond anythingit had yet reached. Henceforward the stream of pilgrims which hadsteadily flowed to the shrine, whether at Lindisfarne, orChester-le-Street, or Durham, swelled in volume until theattractiveness of Durham exceeded that of any place of pilgrimage inEngland. Only when the shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury drew to it solarge a share of patronage from the end of the twelfth century did aserious rival manifest itself. Carileph had divided the territory of St.Cuthbert, reserving part for the Bishop, and part for the Benedictinemonks whom he placed in the new cathedral. Thus the Bishop had hisestates henceforward, and the monks had theirs. At first the portionbelonging to the monastery seems to have been disappointingly poor, afact very probably due to recent ravages whose brand was not yeteffaced. By degrees, however, the lands of prior and convent improved,and the gifts of pilgrims made the monks prosperous.The Bishop who presided when the body of St. Cuthbert was translated in1104 was Ralph Flambard. He was not the character to allow the prestigeof the Bishopric to decline. Under him the resources of the county wereably administered, and the organization of his dominions was carefullydeveloped. By degrees the traces of the Norman harrying wereobliterated. How fair a country Durham was in the early twelfth centurywe may discover from the poetry of a monk from the monastery who wascalled Lawrence, and wrote a description of events and localitiesconnected with Durham. He speaks of its scenery, its excellent products,its fine breed of horses, its open-air amusements, to say nothing ofindoor revels at Christmas. The twelfth century, with sparse population,open moor and plain, and increasing prosperity, is far away from thenoise of anvil and forge, the smoke of endless coke ovens, the squalorof congested towns, as they exist in the county to-day. But the scenechanged too soon. After the accession of Stephen in 1135 fierce dynasticfeuds broke out, and the Scots joined in the anarchy of the time,attempting to annex the territory of St. Cuthbert to the Lowlands ofScotland. Durham suffered severely in the conflict, and a mock-bishop,supported by the Scots, actually held Durham Castle and City againstthe lawful prelate. At length more quiet days came, and in the reign ofHenry II. Bishop Pudsey, the King’s own cousin, succeeded in resistingthe centralizing efforts of the monarch, and although he had to bow tothe imperious Henry on more than one occasion, he carried on in the mainthe liberties and rights of the Bishopric. A little later he was enabledto round off the Bishopric lands when he bought the wapentake ofSadberge from King Richard, the only important part of the county whichhad never yet been included in the territory of St. Cuthbert. From thistime the Earl of Northumbria disappears, and at last there is no rivalwhatsoever to powers which had been steadily growing. The Bishopric isnow complete in head and members, and the Bishop is virtual sovereign ofit, whilst the King is supreme outside. At this stage we may freely callthe Bishop’s dominions the Palatinate of Durham--a name which continuesto be usual until the power so described is, in 1836, annexed to theCrown. The word \"Palatinate\" is a conventional legal title which thelawyers brought into fashion to describe a great franchise with itsindependent jurisdiction.[3]We are able to get a very much clearer notion of the Palatinate inPudsey’s days, when the hitherto scanty materials of Durham historybegin to swell. We have some of his buildings before us yet--St.Cuthbert’s, Darlington, the Galilee of the cathedral, the rich doorwayin the castle; we have seal and charters and writs of his episcopate;and, in short, are able to trace in outline the way in which Pudseydeveloped the Bishopric on the analogy of a little kingdom, withinstitutions and officers of its own. Moreover, some notion is gained inthe famous Boldon Book[4] of the episcopal lands and how they wereheld. There we get a Domesday, as it were, of the Bishop’s holdings, towhich those who desire to study the intricate methods of medieval landtenure on the Bishop’s property must be referred. A little later on wefind somewhat similar information about the lands of the monastery, sothat, as the centuries wear on, a fairly detailed picture is gained ofthe conditions of life in the medieval Bishopric. Thus we see the landsdivided up into a large number of manors, which vary largely incharacter, for some are pastoral, others agricultural, others moor-land,or forest, and others still are connected with townships like Gatesheador Sunderland. The Bishop’s or Prior’s steward makes a circuit atdifferent times, visiting all the units in some special locality, andlooking to his lettings or his rents. The holdings vary very much insize and in tenure, and the tenants likewise differ in status and inservice. There are villeins who are not free, and are bound to rendercertain dues of personal service, mowing, or reaping, or ploughing, orsowing, for so many days, and receiving perhaps doles of food, acottage, and some land, but no money wage. There are farmers who take amanor or farm on condition of rendering so much agricultural produce tothe lord. There are cottiers who work so many days in the week, and haveto give so many eggs, or so many fowls for the table, in return for thelittle home that they occupy. In Durham itself certain houses were letto tenants, who had to defend the North Gate, or help act as garrison,or render herbs and other necessaries for the Bishop’s kitchen. Theconditions of service among the villeins were often onerous, and a toneof deep discontent is marked in the medieval villages of Durham. In timeof war external service might be demanded of the men, and a rally tojoin the Bishopric troops was no unfamiliar incident of life in thosedays. If it extended beyond the bounds proper of the territory of St.Cuthbert, pay was claimed, though it was not always given. Smallquarrels and differences were probably adjusted by steward or bailiff,but more serious cases came before justices of the peace speciallyappointed, whilst murder and other grave offences were reserved forjudges whom the Bishop appointed to sit at various centres, of whichDurham was the chief. And this power of appointing judges to trycriminals and to convict or acquit them is what is meant by the popularand inexact phrase, \"the power of life and death.\" The Bishop’s revenuewas managed by special officers of his own appointment, who got returnsfrom the local bailiffs, and then recorded them at Durham, where aspecial audit was held. A special set of buildings were erected nearDurham Castle, with various adjacent offices, for the management andarrangement of all the mass of business--financial, judicial, andadministrative--which was entailed by the Bishopric.In this way the conditions of life, and the administration of thePalatinate, followed roughly the general order of the kingdom outside,and the Bishopric was, as has already been said, virtually a littlekingdom ruled by a Bishop instead of a King. The Bishops who followedPudsey maintained and developed his organization, but not withoutstrife. The thirteenth century, in particular, presents a long record ofobstinate struggle between the Bishop and those who tried to limit hispower or to gain concessions which he was unwilling to make. Indeed, thestruggle between the King and the people, which is the great feature ofEnglish history in that century, finds a close parallel on a small scalein Durham. At one time it is a long feud between the Bishop and theMonastery over their respective lands, a feud which was at last ended byan agreement between the contending parties. At another time the Bishopis trying to curb the independence of the Barons of the Bishopric, whoheld large estates for which they were supposed to yield homage, or toperform some kind of service. In this way Nevilles and Balliols, two ofthe great Bishopric families, held out against the crusading Bishop Bek,and in the end they had to give way. And once more there was strife onmore than one occasion with the King, who now and then attempted torestrain the exuberant independence of the Bishop of Durham; and here,in the main, the Bishop was successful in asserting his rights andpowers as inalienable.Over this scene of complex organization and activity dark shadows camein the fourteenth century. The Scots, who had been quiescent for sometime, fell upon the Bishopric with great ferocity during the reigns ofthe first three Edwards, and the years were seldom free from the recordof invasion or pillage. It had come to be regarded as a prime duty ofthe Bishop to repress all northern incursions, and, as a contemporarydocument puts it, to serve as a wall of brass against the Scots. He hadhis fortified castles, Norham in Norhamshire, Durham in its own county,and Northallerton in Yorkshire. These three lay on one of the chiefroutes by which the invaders entered England, and were kept inthreatening times well defended and provisioned. In 1312 Bruce pushedhis forces right through Northumberland, and advanced into the heart ofthe Bishopric, delivering a blow against Durham itself, which must havebeen severe. Two years later in Scotland the troops of England werebeaten at Bannockburn, and the humiliation of Edward II. was onlyeffaced some years later by Edward III. in the victories of HalidonHill, and more particularly of Neville’s Cross in 1346. The latterbattle was the great glory of the men of Durham until it was forgottenin the greater prestige of Flodden nearly 200 years later. The tomb ofRalph Neville, badly battered by Scots in later days, still stands inDurham Cathedral as a local memorial of Neville’s Cross, in which he ledthe Bishopric troops.The joy caused by these successes was soon dimmed when the terrors ofthe Black Death overwhelmed the district. Perhaps no part of Englandsuffered much more severely. The pestilence rolled up towards the Northin the year 1349, and at last made its dreaded appearance in thesouth-east of the county. From this point it spread with frightfulrapidity, carrying off all orders and conditions of men, for noneescaped. Sometimes a whole household perished, and here and there anentire village was obliterated. \"No tenants came from West Thickley,because they are all dead,\" is the steward’s entry at one manorial courtor halmote, as the local word is. In the winter that followed there wasno sowing, and when the spring came men had not the heart to go to workon the fields, for the plague was renewed with increasing virulence, andeverything was thrown out of gear. Villeins had run away from sheerterror; even madness was not unheard of; and whilst there was little toeat famine and misery stalked unchecked.[5] The Bishop’s lands and thePrior’s lands were going out of cultivation, for it was impossible tofind labourers, or to bind them down in the old way. Grotesque attemptswere made to keep up the former conditions of service, until by degreesstewards and bailiffs found out that they were face to face with thegreatest economic difficulty which had ever appeared in the Bishopric.The Black Death practically brought to an end the rigid system of landtenure which had been kept up so long, for it gave the death-blow toserfdom, and the old services in kind, of which mention has been made.Discontent had long lurked in the manors of Durham, but from this timeit became active and aggressive, until it pushed the peasants out toassert themselves and to seek for more congenial conditions of life.Elsewhere the transition was effected by bloodshed; in the territoriesof St. Cuthbert it came more peacefully, but to the accompaniment ofmuch mutual mistrust and variance.It is possibly in connection with all this covert rebellion on the partof the masses that Cardinal Langley built or finished the great gaol inthe North Gate in Durham. This large building running up to the castlekeep on one side, and down towards the river on the other, spannedSaddler Street for four centuries, until it was taken down in 1820. Itwas often filled with criminals who were imprisoned here for variousoffences in its gloomy dungeons. There was another gaol at Sadberge, butit does not seem clear what relation this bore to the more importantbuilding in Durham. But the fifteenth century brought its own specialanxieties. In the dynastic troubles which led to the Wars of the Roses,the Palatinate was generally Lancastrian in sympathy. Henry VI. (onlyone of many English Kings who visited Durham) came to the shrine of St.Cuthbert at a time when his dominions had been cut short upon theContinent, and were still further menaced by the Scots. In the bitterdays that followed, when he was driven from his throne, he took refugein the Bishopric, whilst his brave wife went to the Continent to seekfor troops to enable him to regain the crown. Even rectories werefortified in those days, for men had to take one side or the other, andto defend their property against bands of marauders. Of religioustrouble and dispute, Durham had no large share at that particular time,though elsewhere the ferment caused by the Lollard Movement wasproducing much unrest. The Bishopric was too much under the control ofthe Church to allow much freedom of thought. Yet there were isolatedinstances of Lollard sympathy, exceptions to prove the rule, which wereinstantly repressed by ecclesiastical authority.Dynastic trouble did not end when Henry VII. and his wife, Elizabeth,united the Red and White Roses. The Bishopric men, indeed, had no desireto rise against the strong government which the King set up in England;but they were caught in the tide of rebellion which was set going bySimnel and Warbeck. It was to stem this tide that Henry placed RichardFox as Bishop of Durham in 1494. This prelate, the King’s tried friend,fortified afresh the castles of the see, and placed garrisons in themto check the advance of Warbeck through the northern counties.Fortunately, the invasion followed another line to the Battle of Stoke,and the men of Durham were spared the anxiety of decision. But Fox,keeping vigilant guard in his fortresses, was instrumental in concludingthat alliance which was destined eventually to unite the English and theScots as one nation. Henry’s young daughter, Margaret, was affianced toJames IV. of Scotland, and in 1503 passed right through the Bishopric onher way to her northern home. Nowhere in all the long progress did thePrincess receive a warmer welcome than in Durham, from the moment sheentered the Bishopric at the Tees to the moment she crossed Tyne Bridgefrom Gateshead into Newcastle. A mighty banquet was given in her honourin Durham Castle, to which all the nobles and important personages ofthe district were invited. Little Margaret’s great-grandson was JamesVI. of Scotland and I. of England; and in his days border feuds passedaway for ever. And yet at the moment of the banquet that consummationwas a long way off. Ten years later the Scots invaded England at a timeof grave national anxiety, when the King and his troops were warring inFrance. But the Bishopric musters turned out. Bishop Ruthall rushed upto Durham, and his men at Flodden contributed not a little to the greatEnglish success as they bore the banner of St. Cuthbert into the battle.The century that had so recently dawned was destined to witness greatchanges in the Bishopric. Henry VIII. laid ruthless hands upon the powerof the Church, and the monarch who extorted the submission of the clergywas not likely to allow the great power and independence of the Bishopof Durham to pass unchecked. Accordingly, in 1536, he cut short thejudiciary authority of the prelate. This, as we have seen, was one ofthe most characteristic privileges of the Bishop, and neither Henry II.nor Edward I. had interfered with it. From this date the King was theauthority who appointed the judges; and although in practice the oldforms and methods were largely followed, the sanction was royal, and notepiscopal. And next year, when the Council of the North was set up forthe purposes of defence, execution of justice, and finance, in thenorthern counties, a still further blow was aimed at the Bishop’s power,for this court could, if it willed, supersede the Palatinate machinery.As a matter of fact, its first President was Tunstall, Bishop of Durham,who prevented such degradation of the Palatinate for the present. Yetone thing of large importance was carried out under the Council’sauthority, when the great Abbey of Durham was dissolved in 1539. Themonastery had stood unassailed for 450 years, but Henry set going theprocess of destruction which ended in the total suppression of everyreligious house in the land. It had been a wealthy foundation, a kindlylandlord, an influence for good in the district, with its library, andits schools, and its varied means of usefulness. Yet every good objectthat it had served was eventually carried on. Prior and convent becameDean and Canons; monastic lands were now capitular estates; its chiefschool and library were maintained with greater efficiency; its solemnoffices soon became the familiar vernacular service of the Church ofEngland. Otherwise there was little monastic destruction in the countyof Durham, for the great monastery had brooked no rivals; and a friaryor two with a single nunnery were scarcely rivals. The dependent cellsof Jarrow, Wearmouth, Finchale, however, shared in the fall of DurhamAbbey.Three or four years before the surrender of the monastery the people ofDurham had taken part in the Pilgrimage of Grace--that excitingdemonstration in which popular resentment against the fall of thesmaller houses was exhibited. When Durham Abbey fell, there was norepetition of that rising, for severe punishment had been meted out in1537; whilst in 1540 pestilence was desolating the district, and thegloom in consequence was depressing. But there was no sympathy with thechanges which soon began to hurry on, and Durham was probably moreopposed to the Reformation than any other district. Under Edward VI. theBishopric became the object of the ambitious designs ofNorthumberland--one of the noblemen whom the rapid religious andpolitical revolution of the time placed in power. He cast a longing eyeon the Patrimony of St. Cuthbert; and in building up the fortunes of hisupstart family (he was a Dudley, not a Percy, for the trueNorthumberland title was at the moment suspended) he probably intendedto lay hands upon the whole Bishopric, and to arrogate for himself thePalatinate jurisdiction. He succeeded in getting the Bishop thrown intoprison on false charges of treason, and then forced a Bill throughParliament which abolished the power of the Palatinate, and created twosees--one at Durham, the other at Newcastle. There can be little doubtthat he intended to secure the Palatinate power for himself, and to rulein Durham as Duke of Northumberland; whilst his son, Guildford Dudley,recently married to Lady Jane Grey, was to be Prince Consort, and toshare the throne of England. This most daring scheme fell to the groundwhen Mary came to the throne, and the recent legislation was at onceabolished, and things went back to the conditions obtaining before thereign of Edward.Under Elizabeth the Bishopric underwent a process of reconstruction invarious ways. It was not a pleasant process. Socially the old system ofland-tenure, which had been breaking up since the Black Death, wasabolished, and a new method of leaseholds was evolved after muchfriction between the tenants on the one side, and the Dean and Chapter,or the Bishop, on the other. The power of the Bishop was now furtherattenuated, for the Queen laid hands upon large estates which were theundoubted possession of the see, with a history of many centuries’attachment to the Patrimony of St. Cuthbert. The settlement of religioncarried out in the early years of the Queen’s reign was largelyunpalatable in Durham. Certainly the majority of the clergy acquiesced,but the acquiescence was largely external. So the people at largetolerated the changes that were wrought in churches and services, whenthe English liturgy took the place of the Latin offices restored byMary, and when altars were broken down, and the church furniture ingeneral was destroyed. The great Bishopric families--Nevilles, Lumleys,and others--scarcely concealed their dislike of the new régime in Churchand in State, and after some years of endurance, they rose at last in1569. Feeling sure of wide sympathy in Northumberland and Durham, theEarls of Northumberland and Westmorland gathered retainers together, andrestored the old order in Durham Cathedral, whilst the people of Durham,lowly kneeling, were absolved from the guilt of schism. But inferiorleadership caused the rising to collapse outside the Bishopric, and whenthe Queen’s army marched through Durham it swept the undisciplinedforces of the Earls across the Tyne to be dissipated in the rigours of acold Northumbrian winter. But, although the rebellion came to nothing,passive resistance was maintained. As the reign proceeded, this quietercondition was roused into greater activity by the seminary priests andthe Jesuit missionaries who came into the country from institutionsabroad, which sent over into England, and not least into Durham, a longsuccession of these emissaries. They went up and down the district,welcomed and protected by friends who received their ministrations, butnot seldom hunted down by the vigilance of the EcclesiasticalCommission, which increased the stringency of its measures as thecentury drew to its close.The last years of the great Queen witnessed a rather distressingcondition of things in the county. Pestilence was a frequent visitor intimes that were insanitary, and the transition to happier conditions inreligion and in society was not complete. The villages were frequentlyunpopulated, and tillage was decayed, whilst the starving familieswandered into the neighbouring towns in search of food. Probably thedepressing state of affairs was worse in the Bishopric than in otherparts of England, for it received a special aggravation in the Scottishinroads, which were renewed towards the end of the reign before theirfinal extinction at the accession of James. When the Elizabethan PoorLaw began its work, the county of Durham benefited by its operation, forregular collectors for the poor were appointed, and sometimes rates werelevied, in place of the very uncertain alms of the \"poor man’s box\" inthe church, to which parishioners were asked to contribute under theInjunctions of Elizabeth.The Stuarts showed more regard for the Palatinate of Durham than did theTudors. No Tudor sovereign, it seems, entered the county, but James I.,Charles I., and James II. when Duke of York, paid ceremonious visits toDurham, and in general upheld the prestige of the see, though they nevercompletely restored its independence. One of the most interestingepisodes of the seventeenth century is the religious revolution carriedout during the first forty years. Bishop Neile is credited withintroducing to Durham a series of prebendaries who altered the aspect ofthe cathedral and produced great changes in the services. These\"innovations\" caused much comment, and although Charles in 1633 paid aspecial visit, and by his presence and countenance sanctioned what hadbeen done, frequent remonstrance was made. The long reign of ElizabethanChurchmanship had accustomed the people to one uniform type of worshipand ornament, and they were not prepared for the alterations now made inritual and in the appearance of the churches. When the Scots enteredEngland in 1640, by way of remonstrance against the King’s policy inChurch and State, the Bishopric was not altogether unsympathetic; butwhen the armed demonstration proved to be an armed occupation extendingover a year in duration, the royalism of Durham re-asserted itself. Atthe outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 it was warmly royalist. A secondScottish occupation after Marston Moor in 1644 kept this spirit incheck, whilst the Long Parliament virtually superseded the Palatinateand governed the district by committees. Bishop, prebendaries, and otherhigh ecclesiastics had fled when the Scots entered Durham in 1640.Parliament now seized upon the lands of Bishop and Chapter, and soldthem or let them as opportunity offered. Thus for several years the oldecclesiastical constitution of Durham was destroyed, and in the parishchurches, carefully cleared in 1644 from all \"monuments of idolatry,\" aPresbyterian system was set up. It was not, however, fully carried out,and all manner of ministers were in possession when the Protectorate wasset up in 1653. The cathedral services had long been silenced, and in1650 Cromwell used the buildings as a convenient accommodation for theScottish prisoners captured at Dunbar. On the petition of the people ofthe county, the Protector undertook to establish a college in Durham andto devote the cathedral and castle buildings to that purpose. Resentmentand discontent smouldered during these years of tyranny. Indeed, morethan one Royalist rising had to be repressed. When, at the beginning of1660, there was talk of restoring the King, no voice of dissent washeard in the county.Exuberant loyalty greeted the Restoration. Cosin was made Bishop. He wasone of the group of influential men appointed by Neile forty yearsbefore, and now for twelve years he repaired the breaches of the cityand diocese, and carried out the principles which he had formed inearlier life. The Palatinate jurisdiction was revived, with perhapsgreater lustre than it had exhibited for a century past. In these daysof royalist triumph Nonconformist and Puritan scarcely ventured at firstto show their heads, but in Durham they were only biding their time.They found opportunity to promote a formidable rising, which was knownas the Derwentdale Plot, aiming at some kind of overthrow of therestored Church and Crown. It was badly managed, and speedily collapsed;but Anabaptists, Quakers, and other parties managed to maintain theirexistence despite strenuous measures, and more particularly despite thevigorous working of the Conventicle Acts which were intended to crushNonconformity.Generally speaking, the county of Durham accepted the Revolution in1688, though here and there some reluctance was manifested, andnotwithstanding the efforts of Bishop Crewe and Dean Granville topromote allegiance to King James. Jacobitism, indeed, was spasmodic inthe Bishopric, and it does not appear that in 1715 or in 1745 very widesympathy was exhibited in the district when elsewhere the excitement wasconsiderable. The eighteenth century witnessed two events of thegreatest importance in Durham history. In the first place, after aperiod of long stagnation, industrial development caught the wholedistrict and entirely changed its character. The coal trade had beenprosecuted continuously since the thirteenth century at least, and themines had proved a considerable source of revenue to the owners. Leadwas an ancient industry, and the salt-pans of the county have aconnected history, ranging over many centuries. These and otheroperations had increased in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,more particularly when a great development of shipping at Sunderland andat Hartlepool took place after the Restoration. A large export trade bysea spread rapidly. In the early part of the eighteenth century 175,000tons of coal was the annual output on the Wear, and the history of thecollier convoys at that time is a large chapter in the general historyof North Country shipping. All this meant a considerable increase ofprosperity, and by degrees the county which had been thinly populated,for the most part, became a hive of industry, in which rapid fortuneswere made. The mines and the shipyards attracted labour from other partsof England, and the population of the county, returned as 58,860 in theearly days of Elizabeth, amounted to 149,384 in 1801, a figure which hasbeen multiplied by ten in the last hundred years. The Bishop and theDean and Chapter largely shared in the vast increase of wealth which theworking of coal-mines in particular produced. It cannot, however, besaid with truth that the Church authorities neglected the cause ofcharity. A list of the benefactions directly due to the various Bishops,and also to Dean and Chapter, shows how much they did in various waysfor the cause of education as well as for the spiritual well-being ofthe people. Indeed, subscription lists of the early nineteenth century,which still survive, prove that the clergy gave the chief proportion ofwhat was given when some public call was made. It must not be forgottenthat Durham University and Durham School were the direct foundations ofthe Church within the Bishopric.The other important event to which allusion has been made was theappearance of the Wesleyan Movement in Durham. Bishop Butler wrote hisfamous work, the _Analogy_, in the western parts of the county, andpublished it in 1736. It may be doubted whether its local effect wasconsiderable. Within a few years John Wesley passed and repassed throughthe county, and established his societies in Durham, Sunderland,Darlington, and elsewhere. They prospered exceedingly, and left apermanent impression upon the district, and this was deepened andextended when a fresh wave of Methodism travelled over the North ofEngland early in the nineteenth century in connection with the spread ofPrimitive Methodism. There can be no manner of doubt that the MethodistMovement deeply stirred and influenced some classes of the increasingpopulation which the Church left untouched.The real dividing-line between Old Durham and the present day is to befound in the series of changes which took place in the reign of WilliamIV. The spirit of reform was operating in various directions, and it wasnot likely that Durham could escape. The increasing wealth of the Churchand the still independent powers of the Bishop attracted the attentionof the party of change. The Dean and Chapter rose to their opportunity,and founded the University of Durham. The newly formed EcclesiasticalCommission reduced the large staff of the cathedral, and reduced thestipends of those who were left. The Bishop was henceforth to be nolonger a great landowner, managing his own revenues and estates, but aprelate, like any other, drawing a fixed stipend. His officers went, andthe Palatinate jurisdiction which Dudley had coveted was finally annexedto the Crown. Thus to-day George V. is, within the confines of theBishopric, Earl Palatine of Durham.TOPOGRAPHY OF DURHAMBY MISS M. HOPE DODDS_Hist. Tripos, Cantab.__The Great North Road._The Great North Road crosses the Tees by Croft Bridge, on which theboundary between Yorkshire and Durham is marked by a stone dated 1627.This road is the \"Darnton Trod,\" along which criminals from the Southsought refuge all through the Middle Ages. Once across the Tees thefugitive was safe, for the King’s writ did not run in the Bishopric.Moreover, this was the road to the great sanctuary of St. Cuthbert atDurham, where a man was safe from the vengeance of his enemies; and soit happened that Darlington became a great resort of evil-doers, and in1311 Bishop Kellaw issued a proclamation threatening with the terrors ofexcommunication all those who molested merchants going to and returningfrom Darlington market. The ill-name of the neighbourhood was not lostafter the Bishop had been deprived of his own writs in 1536. The littleinn of Baydale was the resort of the gentlemen of the road in theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the rendezvous of Catton’s gang,the haunt of Barwick and of Sir William Browne, all noted highwaymen ofthe North.The first hamlet in Durham through which the road passes is Oxneyfield,where, in the fields by the wayside, may be seen the Hell Kettles, fourdark, still pools, formed by the natural sinking of the soil over thesalt measures in the north bank of the Tees. There is a tradition thatan Eastern diver, a black man, plunged into one of the pools, andreappeared in the Skerne, having discovered a subterranean connectionbetween the two waters. The Black Man in North Country legends isusually the devil, and this story may be connected with the belief thatthe Hell Kettles sometimes grow boiling hot, and that the devil \"seethesthe souls of sinful men and women in them,\" at which times the spiritsmay be heard to cry and yell about the pools.[Illustration: THE MARKET-CROSS AT DARLINGTON.]Passing by this haunted place the road leads on to Darlington, a boroughfull of historical relics, from the Bulmer Stone in Northgate to thefirst locomotive at Bank Top Station. The Bulmer Stone is a largeboulder of Shap granite, which was borne down to its presentresting-place on a glacier in the Ice Age. Lying in the midst of thelevel, marshy plains of the Skerne, it formed a landmark for the men ofthe Bronze Age, and was perhaps the origin of the town. An Anglianburial-ground, probably pre-Christian, was discovered in the town in1876. After the conversion of the North a church was built, and twoSaxon crosses from it are preserved in the present Church of St.Cuthbert. The history of this beautiful building does not come withinthe scope of the present section. To the west of the church lies themarket-place, where in 1217 Stephen de Cantuaria purchased half a poundof pepper at the fair on the Feast of All Saints, which he rendered toRoger Fitzacris as service for this land in Milneflach and elsewhere.From the market-cross in 1312 was read the Bishop’s order that atournament which had been proclaimed at Darlington should not be held,as it was forbidden by the laws of the land. That market-cross is notstanding now, but its successor may be seen in the modern coveredmarket, a plain column surmounted by a ball, which was erected in 1727by Dame Dorothy Brown, the last descendant of the family of Barnes,whose members had held the office of bailiff of Darlington for over ahundred years. The old toll-booth, in which the bailiffs held theircourts, was pulled down in 1806 and replaced by the present Town Hall.Ever since 1197, Darlington enjoyed the title of borough, and yet itpossesses no early charters and had no corporate government; it was notvisited by the municipal commissioners in 1833, and was onlyincorporated in 1868. Until its incorporation the Bishop of Durhamappointed a bailiff, who held the old manorial court of the borough.Darlington enjoys the distinction of having retained its bailiff untilthe middle of the nineteenth century, whereas in the other Durham townsthe Bishop had ceased to appoint bailiffs by the end of the seventeenthcentury. The fame of Darlington rests on the fact that the firstpassenger railway-line in England was laid between Darlington andStockton by George Stephenson, who was supported by the capital andinfluence of Edward Pease of Darlington; the line was opened in 1825.This is surely glory enough for any town![Illustration: AN OLD TITHE-BARN AT DURHAM.]Great Aycliffe, lying five miles north of Darlington on the highroad,was once one of the lesser forests of the Bishopric. About four milesnorth of Aycliffe the road crosses a little stream by the hamlet ofRushyford. This was a desolate spot in 1317, when on September 1 LewisBeaumont, Bishop-elect of Durham, and the Cardinals Gaucelin John andLuke Fieschi, with a numerous train of attendants, travelled towardsDurham, Beaumont to be consecrated in the cathedral, the Cardinals tonegotiate a truce between England and Scotland. They had been warned atDarlington that the road was beset, and this warning, which theydisregarded, proved only too true, for as they crossed the gloomy littleburn at Rushyford, they were set upon by the notorious freebooter, SirGilbert Middleton, and his men. The Cardinals and their servants werestripped of their goods and allowed to continue their journey, but theborderers carried off the Bishop-elect to their fortress of MitfordCastle, and there held him to ransom, until the Prior and Convent ofDurham by great sacrifices succeeded in redeeming him.The next place of importance on the road is Ferryhill, a large modernvillage six and a half miles south of Durham. Few traces of the pastsurvive here, except the fragment of an old stone cross, Cleve’s Cross,which is traditionally held to commemorate the slaying of a great wildboar, which ravaged Durham once upon a time, by a certain valiant Rogerde Ferry, whose family long dwelt in the neighbourhood in great honour.About a mile to the south-east of Ferryhill is Mainsforth, the estate ofRobert Surtees, the historian of Durham.Midway between Ferryhill and Durham the highroad crosses the River Wearby Sunderland Bridge, and passes through the suburbs into the city ofDurham.A bird’s-eye view of the city of Durham even at the present day issurprisingly beautiful. In the Middle Ages it would have served as amodel for one of those fascinating little Jerusalems or Bethlehems,walled, towered, and pinnacled, which the old Italian masters loved toperch on the craggy hills in the background of some sacred picture. Theriver sweeps round three sides of the crag, which is crowned by thecathedral and the castle, and the narrow neck of land on the fourth sidewas defended by a moat. The Prior’s borough of Elvet and the merchants’quarter of Framwellgate lay on the opposite bank of the river, and wereconnected with the citadel itself by their bridges.The monastic chroniclers of the see were chiefly interested in thedoings of the Bishop in his castle and the Prior in his cathedral, andthe occasional interventions of the Lord King in the quarrels of theseaugust persons; they tell comparatively little of the life and affairsof the burgesses themselves, the descendants of the men from betweenCoquet and Tees, who obeyed the summons of Earl Ucthred in 995, andhastened to Durham to raise a shrine worthy of St. Cuthbert, who clearedthe thick forest on the crag of Durham, divided the land by lot, andbecame the Haliwerfolc, the people of the Saint. Twice during theeleventh century they were besieged by the Scots, and each time theenemy was routed. The heads of the slaughtered Scots were exposed in themarket-place, where the great fair of Durham was held on September 4,the Feast of the Translation of St. Cuthbert. There was also a fair onthe saint’s other festival, March 20; but the September fair was themore important. The laws of the special peace of St. Cuthbert, which wasproclaimed by the thanes and drengs before the fair opened, were writtenin an ancient Gospel-Book, and a copy of them is still preserved.In the winter of 1068-69 Robert Cumin, the newly created Norman Earl ofNorthumberland, advanced to Durham with his troops, but as the Normanslay there they were surprised by a sudden rising of the wholepopulation, and slain almost to a man. A year later news came thatWilliam himself was approaching Durham to avenge the death of Cumin,whereupon Bishop Egelwin and the priests took the sacred body of St.Cuthbert and such of the treasures of the church as they could carry andfled to Lindisfarne, followed by the people of the city, who dared notremain without the sacred relic. The whole multitude took refuge on theisland while William devastated Durham and Northumberland. At lengthpeace was made, and St. Cuthbert and his followers returned to thedesolate city. In 1072 William visited Durham, and installed theforeigner, Bishop Walcher, in the see. About this time also the firstNorman castle was built in the city to keep the people in check; butwhen Bishop Walcher ventured out of his stronghold in 1080 he wasmurdered. Again William ravaged Durham, and the see was filled by BishopWilliam de St. Carileph, who began to build the present cathedral, andwho founded the Benedictine monastery connected with it. To the newmonastery he gave forty merchants’ houses in Elvet, which formed thenucleus of the Prior’s borough of Elvet. The troubles of Durhamrecommenced in 1140, when, the see being vacant, Durham Castle wasseized by William Cumin, a nominee of King David of Scotland, who hopedthrough Cumin to annex the Bishopric. In the course of the strugglebetween the usurper and the new Bishop, William de St. Barbara, thegreater part of the city of Durham was reduced to ashes. There were fouryears of desperate warfare before Bishop William entered his cathedraltown, and at last received the submission of Cumin. Even then therecould be no true peace while England was torn with civil war, and it wasnot until after the death of Bishop William that a brighter day dawnedwith the election of Bishop Hugh Pudsey. Bishop Hugh rebuilt the ruinedcity, restored the fortifications, and added to the cathedral. Hegranted the burgesses a charter, by which the customs ofNewcastle-on-Tyne were confirmed to them, besides freedom from merchet,heriot, and toll. The city of Durham stands first in Bishop Pudsey’sgreat survey of the Bishopric (Boldon Book, compiled in 1183), when thecity was at farm for 60 marks. Records which relate to the actual lifeof the citizens do not begin until the fourteenth century. The earliestare various charters of murage, dated 1345, 1377, 1385, which authorizedthe citizens to levy certain tolls, and to devote the proceeds to therepair of the walls and streets. The city was governed[Illustration: BISHOP PUDSEY’S CHARTER.]by a bailiff, appointed by the Bishop, in the same way as Darlington. Itis not until the fifteenth century that gilds are heard of in Durham. In1436 Bishop Langley granted a licence to several of the principalinhabitants to form the religious gild of Corpus Christi in the Churchof St. Nicholas, in the market-place. This gild was closely connectedwith the craft gilds of the town, which must have been in existence atthe beginning of the century. The first records of the gilds occur in1447, when the Shoemakers (Cordwainers) and the Fullers each gaverecognizances to the Bishop that they would forfeit 20s. to him and 20s.to the light of Corpus Christi if any member took a Scot as anapprentice. The ordinances of the Weavers were enrolled and confirmed bythe Bishop in 1450, and in them reference is made to the play which wasto be played when they went in procession on Corpus Christi Day. Thegilds were not merely a picturesque feature of town life, they had alsoa powerful influence on the development of the city. The corporationgranted by Bishop Pilkington’s charter of 1565--the first charter ofincorporation which the city obtained--was probably modelled on thegoverning body of the Corpus Christi Gild. The governing charter of thecity until 1770 was granted by Bishop Toby Matthew in 1602, and by thischarter the Common Council of the town was to consist of twenty-fourpersons, two being chosen from each of the twelve principal companies bythe mayor and aldermen. When the city of Durham obtained Parliamentaryrepresentation in 1678, the franchise of the borough could only beobtained by membership in one of the companies, and the procedure ofadmission was therefore carefully regulated by the mayor andcorporation. But in 1761 Durham experienced two elections within a fewmonths of each other, and the political excitement completelydemoralized the city. All restraints were thrown to the winds, andnumbers of new freemen were admitted in a most irregular manner. Thereaction of this exciting time on municipal affairs was such that, in1770, more than half the number of the twelve aldermen had resigned orbeen removed, and it was therefore impossible to elect a mayor under thecharter of 1603, which consequently lapsed. The various feuds havingbeen cooled by an interval of ten years, Bishop Egerton granted a newcharter in 1780, with provisions closely resembling those of the oldone, and under this charter Durham was governed until it was included inthe Municipal Corporations Act of 1835.The North Road, on leaving Durham, follows the course of one of theRoman roads which passed through the county. It leads northward overFramwellgate Moor, and six miles from Durham passes throughChester-le-Street, which lies on the banks of the Cone Burn. As the nameindicates, a Roman camp was situated here, and numerous Roman remainshave been found. The monks who had fled from Lindisfarne in 876 with thebody of St. Cuthbert settled at Chester-le-Street after seven years’wandering, when peace had been confirmed by the agreement between Alfredand Guthred the Dane. It was the principal city of the see until 995,when Bishop Aldhune fled once more before the renewed invasions of theDanes. In Chester-le-Street the old custom is still kept up of playing afootball-match, in which the whole village takes part, on ShroveTuesday.The borough of Gateshead lies on the Tyne, eight miles north ofChester-le-Street. The south end of Tyne Bridge was the site of a Romancamp, and afterwards, in the seventh century, of a Saxon monastery,which was destroyed by the Danes. A little church which stood there in1080 was the scene of the murder of Bishop Walcher, who was killed bythe infuriated populace while he was trying to pacify a feud between hisNorman followers and the Saxon nobles. The church was set on fire, andthe Bishop was killed as he rushed from the burning building. The tracesof early Norman work in the present building show that it must have soonbeen rebuilt. The new church is first mentioned in 1256, when aprisoner who had escaped from the castle of Newcastle took refuge inGateshead Church. Gateshead’s only charter was granted by Bishop HughPudsey at some time between 1154 and 1183, and confirmed by hissuccessor, Bishop Philip of Poitou. The little borough lay on theoutskirts of the Bishop’s forest of Gateshead, and the charter freed theburgesses to some extent from the tyranny of that very great man, theBishop’s Head Forester. In its form of government the borough wassimilar to Darlington. Gateshead has always been one of the principalcommercial centres of the county, and, though there are no signs ofcraft gilds there, trade companies second in importance only to those ofDurham existed from the reign of Elizabeth till the end of theeighteenth century. The prosperity of Gateshead very early excited thealarm of Newcastle, and the history of the town is studded with theattempts of its jealous neighbour to suppress its trade. In thefourteenth century the efforts of the Newcastle Corporation weredirected against the fisheries and staithes on the south bank of theTyne, which were frequently destroyed by \"the malice of the men ofNewcastle.\" In 1553 the two towns were united, but the Act was repealedby Queen Mary, who came to the throne in the same year. It was proposedto renew the union in 1568, but the anxious petitions of Gateshead, andthe opposition of several influential persons in the Palatinate,frustrated the scheme. There are, however, several cases in thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries of the interference of Newcastlewith the trade of Gateshead. These troubles were the price thatGateshead had to pay for its advantageous position by the side of thegreater town. Gateshead was given one representative in the House ofCommons by the Reform Act of 1832, and was incorporated by its inclusionin the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835.The boundary of Durham is now the south bank of the Tyne, but formerlythe Bishop’s jurisdiction extended over one-third of the river, and wasmarked by a blue stone on Tyne Bridge. The old bridge, which stood wherethe Swing Bridge is now, was built in 1248 to replace the Roman bridge,Pons Ælii, which dated from _circa_ 119. In 1389 the burgesses ofNewcastle carried off the Blue Stone, seized the whole of the bridge,and built a tower on the south end, which they held against the Bishop.It was not until 1415 that Bishop Langley at length obtained judgmentagainst the Corporation of Newcastle, and took possession of the towerwith all his chivalry. The tower stood until the great flood of 1771,when part of the bridge was swept away. After this catastrophe the wholewas rebuilt, the new bridge being completed in 1781. The High-LevelBridge was built in 1849, and the present Swing Bridge replaced the oldstone one in 1876. Meanwhile, the conservation of the River Tyne hadbeen placed in the hands of commissioners, and the jurisdiction of theBishop over the river came to an end._Durham to South Shields._The city of Durham, lying almost in the centre of the county, is anexcellent point of departure from which to visit the other towns andplaces of interest in the Bishopric. The road which leads from the cityto the mouth of the Tyne runs north-east from Framwellgate Bridge. Theprincipal village through which it passes is Houghton-le-Spring, six anda half miles from Durham. The place is closely associated with the nameof Bernard Gilpin, the Apostle of the North, who in the reigns of EdwardVI., Mary, and Elizabeth, was Rector of Houghton-le-Spring, and thechief instrument in spreading Protestant doctrines through the North.From here it is seven miles to the mouth of the Wear, where stands theflourishing port of Sunderland. In early records the town[Illustration: JACK CRAWFORD’S BIRTH-PLACE, SUNDERLAND.]is usually called Wearmouth. It possesses two very interesting charters,dated respectively 1180-83 and 1634; nevertheless, it did not rise abovethe level of a manorial borough until 1835, when it was included in theMunicipal Corporations Act. During the Civil War Sunderland was theprincipal centre of the Parliamentarians in Durham, which was on thewhole a Royalist county. The fact that Sunderland was an exception wasdue to the influence of the family of Lilburne in the town, GeorgeLilburne, the uncle of the famous John Lilburne, being the onlymagistrate in the borough during the war. At the same time the siege ofNewcastle diverted the coal trade to Sunderland, and thus laid thefoundation of its present prosperity. The town is famous in naval andmilitary history as the birthplace of two heroes--Jack Crawford, who\"nailed the colours to the mast\" at the Battle of Camperdown, 1797, andSir Henry Havelock, who relieved Lucknow in 1857. The Sunderland OrphanAsylum was founded in 1853 by the Freemen and Stallingers of Sunderland,and endowed with the proceeds of the sale of the Town Moor, which hadbecome exceedingly valuable in consequence of the building of therailway. The road crosses the Wear, and enters the parish ofMonkwearmouth.The history of Monkwearmouth goes back to 674, when Benedict Biscopfounded there the monastery of St. Peter. The early history of themonastery was recorded by the Venerable Bede, who relates how Benedictbrought over foreign masons and glass-workers to build his church, andbeautified it with sacred pictures brought from Rome. It was destroyedby the Danes towards the end of the ninth century, refounded by BishopWalcher, _circa_ 1075, and finally annexed to the Convent of Durham byBishop William de St. Carileph in 1083. A cell of the convent wasmaintained there until the Reformation, and Monkwearmouth continued tobe a manor belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Durham until it wasincorporated with Sunderland.From Monkwearmouth the road runs parallel with the coast-line to SouthShields. Shield Lawe, at the mouth of the Tyne, was occupied inpre-Roman times; an important Roman camp was built there; and later itwas one of the fortresses of the Saxon Kings of Northumbria, and thesite of St. Hilda’s first religious house, founded _circa_ 650. Thelittle convent was overshadowed by Benedict Biscop’s great monastery ofSt. Paul at Jarrow, and both fell before the onslaughts of the Danes.Jarrow subsequently became a cell of the Convent of Durham, and theChapel of St. Hilda at South Shields kept alive the name of thefoundress. After centuries of struggle with the burgesses of Newcastle,who put down the trade of South Shields with a high hand, the boroughobtained Parliamentary representation in 1832, and incorporation in1850. In the seventeenth century the salt-pans of South Shields were aflourishing industry, but its chief importance is now its harbour. Thefirst lifeboat was built and used there in 1790._Durham to Hartlepool._The twenty miles of road between Durham and Hartlepool is of anuninteresting character; but the town of Hartlepool itself has a longhistory, which begins in 640, when St. Hieu founded a convent there, ofwhich St. Hilda was afterwards abbess. The house was destroyed by theDanes, and Hartlepool disappears from history, to reappear at the end ofthe twelfth century as a flourishing port belonging to Robert de Bruce,Lord of Annandale. Hitherto it had not been included in the Bishopric ofDurham, but in 1189 the overlordship of the whole district of Hartnesswas bought by Bishop Hugh Pudsey from Richard I. The succeeding Bishop,Philip de Poitou, obtained possession of the town, but not until theburgesses had bought a charter from King John in 1200, granting to themthe customs of Newcastle-on-Tyne, while the same King granted to Williamde Bruce, Lord of Hartlepool, the right to hold a weekly market and afair at the Feast of St. Lawrence (August 10). The burgesses obtainedanother charter from Bishop Richard le Poore in 1230, in which heconceded to them the right to form a Merchant Gild and to elect a mayor.From this time the burgesses of Hartlepool were able to manage their ownaffairs in their own way, and enjoyed more independence than there wasin any of the other towns of Durham. Their chief misfortunes befell themafter Robert de Bruce became King of Scotland in 1305. Hartlepoolescheated to the King of England, and in consequence the Scots felt aspecial enmity against it. The town was attacked more than once in theensuing wars, but the walls and ramparts, which had been built by Robertde Bruce (1245-95) made it one of the strongest places in the Bishopric.At the beginning of the nineteenth century these fortifications werestill among the finest specimens of Edwardian architecture in thekingdom, but when the trade of the town revived later in the century,the ancient walls were pulled down to make way for the new pier anddocks, and hardly any trace of them now remains. In 1599, by the goodoffices of Lord Lumley, the burgesses of Hartlepool obtained from QueenElizabeth a charter of incorporation, under which the town was governeduntil 1834, when the conditions of the charter were not fulfilled, andit lapsed. The present governing charter of the town was obtained in1850. The borough of West Hartlepool has grown up in the nineteenthcentury on the south side of the bay on which Hartlepool stands._Durham to Stockton._The Durham and Stockton road passes through Bishop Middleham, where oneof the Bishop’s manor-houses used to stand, and through Sedgefield,about eleven miles from Durham, a market-town which received the grantof a weekly market and fair at the Feast of St. Edmund the Bishop(November 16) from Bishop Kellaw in 1312.The borough of Stockton lies on the north bank of the Tees, twenty milessouth of Durham. It is situated in the district which in early timesformed the wapentake of Sadberg, and comprised all the lands lying alongthe north bank of the river. The wapentake, which was purchased byBishop Pudsey in 1189, at the same time as Hartlepool, had a separateorganization from the rest of the Bishopric, and its courts were held atSadberg, which is now a small village about three miles east ofDarlington. Stockton itself, however, seems to have come into theBishop’s hands before the purchase of the wapentake, as it is includedin the Boldon Book, 1183. The date of the incorporation of the boroughis unknown, but there are grants by several of the Bishops, dated 1310,1602, and 1666, of a weekly market and a fair at the Feast of St. Thomasà Becket (December 29). There is also an interesting letter relating tothe customs practised both at Newcastle and at Stockton, which was sentby the Mayor of Newcastle[Illustration: THE PALACE, BISHOP AUCKLAND.]to the Mayor of Stockton in 1344 in reply to certain questions which thepeople of Stockton had addressed to Newcastle as their mother town. Themunicipal government of the borough was in the hands of the mayor andthe borough-holders, seventy-two in number, until Stockton was includedin the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835._Durham to Barnard Castle._The road to Barnard Castle branches off from the North Road about a milesouth of Sunderland Bridge, and travels south-west into Aucklandshire.This district included Binchester, Escomb, Newton, and all theAucklands, Bishop Auckland, St. Andrew’s Auckland, St. Helen’s Auckland,and South Auckland. Aucklandshire lay on the borders of the Bishop’sgreat forest of Weardale, and the services of the tenants, as describedin Boldon Book, were closely connected with the Bishop’s greathunting-parties in the forest. All the tenants had to provide ropes forsnaring the deer, and to help to build the Bishop’s hall in the forest,with a larder, a buttery, a chamber, a chapel, and a fence round thewhole encampment, when the Bishop went on the great hunt. They also kepteyries of falcons for the Bishop, and attended the roe-hunt whensummoned. In return for their services at the great hunt they received atun of beer, or half a tun if the Bishop did not come, and 2s. \"as afavour.\" The little town of Bishop Auckland was called a borough in thefourteenth century, when the weekly markets and the fairs held onAscension Day, Corpus Christi Day, and the Thursday before October 10,formed the chief commercial centre of the neighbourhood, but it hasnever been incorporated, and is now an urban district.To the south of Aucklandshire lies the barony of Evenwood, about aquarter of a mile west of the road. This was one of the early baroniesof the Bishopric, held by the family of Hansard. Evenwood was bought byBishop Bek in 1294, and his successors maintained a manor-house and parkthere. After passing by Evenwood, the road leads through Raby Park toStaindrop.Staindrop was one of the vills over which the Bishop and the Convent ofDurham disputed at the beginning of the twelfth century. Bishop RalphFlambard restored it to the monks by the charter of restitution which heexecuted on his death-bed; and they kept it out of the clutches ofsucceeding Bishops by granting it in 1131 at an annual rental of £4 toDolphin, son of Ughtred, one of the progenitors of the family ofNeville. Henceforward, Staindrop remained part of the Neville estates inthe Bishopric. In 1378 Bishop Hatfield granted to John Lord Neville theright to hold a weekly market and a fair there at the Feast of St.Thomas the Martyr (December 21). The whole of the Neville estates wereconfiscated in 1570, after the rebellion of the Earls of Northumberlandand Westmorland in 1569, and Staindrop remained in the hands of the Kinguntil 1632, when it was purchased by Sir Henry Vane, from whom thepresent owner, Lord Barnard, is descended.Barnard Castle is twenty-five miles from Durham, and lies on the northbank of the Tees. It did not form part of the Bishopric at the time ofthe Conquest, and was granted by William Rufus to Guy Balliol in 1093.Barnard Balliol, his son, built the castle _circa_ 1132, and apparentlyfounded the borough, for the first extant charter, granted by his sonBarnard to the burgesses of Barnard Castle _circa_ 1167, refers to theelder Barnard’s concessions to them. By this charter the burgesses weregranted the customs of Richmond (Yorks). Barnard Castle was a manorialborough, and is now an urban district. The burgesses obtained chartersfrom Hugh (1212-28), John (_circa_ 1230), and Alexander, third son ofJohn. All the Balliol estates in England were forfeited by John Balliol,sometime King of Scotland, in 1295. Barnard Castle was claimed by BishopBek, but Edward I. granted it to Guy[Illustration: BARNARD CASTLE.]Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. The Bishops of Durham made frequent effortsto obtain possession of the town, and although they were unsuccessful,they obtained Parliamentary recognition of the fact that Barnard Castlewas part of the Bishopric. Richard III., by his marriage with Lady Anneof Warwick, became lord of the town, which Lady Anne inherited from herfather, the King-maker. Barnard Castle escheated to the crown in 1485,and was finally granted to the Earl of Westmorland. In 1569, onreceiving the news that the northern Earls had risen against the Queen,Sir George Bowes of Streatlam seized and garrisoned the castle, where hewas besieged by the rebels; and although he was forced to surrenderafter a ten days’ siege, the delay had given the royal troops time tocome up, and insured the defeat of the insurgents. After the rebellionBarnard Castle escheated to the crown again, and was leased to thevaliant Bowes. It was finally purchased by Sir Henry Vane in 1632 (seeabove)._Durham to Alston._The road from Durham to Alston, in Cumberland, passes by the field ofthe Battle of Neville’s Cross, fought on St. Luke’s Eve, October 17,1346, in which David of Scotland, who had invaded England while EdwardIII. and all his forces were in France, was defeated by the troops whichhe contemptuously called \"an army of women and priests,\" because theywere raised by Queen Philippa, and the four divisions were commanded bythe Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the Bishops of Lincoln andDurham. The cross which Ralph, Lord Neville, erected on the battle-fieldwas destroyed in 1589.The next place of interest on the road is Brancepeth, which lies fourand a half miles south-west of Durham. The family of Bulmer ofBrancepeth held one of the early baronies of the Bishopric (see underEvenwood); the estate finally descended to an heiress, the first of themany noble ladies whose stories lend interest to the place. She marriedGeoffry de Neville, _circa_ 1150. Sixty years after, in 1227, there wasagain a sole heiress to Brancepeth; she married Robert FitzMeldred, Lordof Raby, and her son assumed his mother’s name, becoming the firstNeville of Raby and Brancepeth. When the Neville estates were forfeitedin 1570, the Countess of Westmorland was allowed to remain at thecastle, and there, though beset by spies, she contrived her husband’sescape to Flanders. The surveys of the estate that were made in 1597 and1614 mention that wild cattle were preserved in Brancepeth Park, as theystill are at Chillingham. The escheated lands passed from one owner toanother. In 1769 they were again inherited by an heiress, Bridgit, theonly daughter of William Bellasis. She died five years after coming intoher inheritance. The story goes that she pined away for love of aneighbouring squire, Robert Shafto, who had wooed and forsaken her; andthe old Bishopric song of \"Bobby Shafto\" is said to be the record of thebrief happiness of the lovelorn lady.The market-town of Wolsingham lies sixteen miles west of Durham. It wasone of the Bishop’s forest vills, lying on the moors of Weardale; and inthe entry about it in Boldon Book mention is made of Ralf the Beekeeper,who held six acres for his service in keeping the bees, which were sentout on to the blossoming heather in the twelfth century, as they are tothis day. Wolsingham lies on the north bank of the Wear, and, afterpassing through the village, the road follows the course of the riverwestward to Stanhope, which lies in the lead-mining district of WestDurham. Half-way between Wolsingham and Stanhope lies Frosterley, whereare the quarries of Frosterley marble.Stanhope itself lay in the heart of the forest of Weardale, and was thespot to which all those who owed hunting-service must make their waywhen the Bishop’s great hunt was proclaimed. In 1327 the English and[Illustration: BRANCEPETH CASTLE IN 1777.]Scottish armies, commanded on the one side by Edward III., and on theother by the Earl of Murray and Sir James Douglas, lay encamped for somedays over against each other on the hills round Stanhope. No battle wasfought, and the Scots withdrew by night, having deceived Edward by falseintelligence. The remains of the earthworks in which the two armiesentrenched themselves may still be seen.St. John’s Chapel, seven miles west of Stanhope, is the lastconsiderable village on the road to Alston before it crosses theboundary of Durham. The chapel is mentioned in the fifteenth century,and a market and annual fair were held there, but there were fewinhabitants until the end of the eighteenth century. From St. John’sChapel the road leads up over the moors, past the sources of the Wear,and crosses the county boundary on Killhope Moor.FOLK-LORE OF THE COUNTY OF DURHAMBY MRS. NEWTON W. APPERLEYWhoever makes a study of the folk-lore of a county will find that itscustoms, beliefs, and superstitions, have their origin in immemorialantiquity. To find out the reason for many a curious and apparentlyfrivolous observance it is necessary to go back many centuries, to thetime when a nature-worship, already immeasurably old, was practised;when the sun and moon, fire, water, and earth, were personified by godsand goddesses. Festivals were held in honour of each, and stones andtrees, wells and rivers, had their temples and devotees. These wereoverlaid by and mingled with the successive rituals of Roman, Saxon, andDane, and finally were almost, but not quite, conquered by Christianity.The older faiths made a stubborn resistance to the reformer, and thoughadapted and altered, many of their usages survive to this day.The four great Fire Festivals of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter wereChristianized and dedicated anew; some of the gods and goddesses werere-named as saints; and many of the rites belonging to their worshipwere modified into Christian observances.But the people kept their old superstitions, and placed their faith inthe charms and amulets belonging to the ancient worship. In the Northespecially the old beliefs lingered long, and even now, in the twentiethcentury, many quaint customs are to be found. Most of the people whopractise them could give no reason for so doing, and have certainly noknowledge of their origin. It is \"lucky\" to do this, and \"unlucky\" to dothat, is all they can say.The county of Durham, though the especial patrimony and property of St.Cuthbert, is particularly rich in legends and traditions, in places bothhaunted and hallowed, and in old-world observances of all kinds. Manyare the stories of giants, brownies, fairies, ghosts, witches, and\"worms\" or dragons, told of and in it.The Gabriel Hounds--those monstrous human-headed dogs, whose pause overa house is said to bring death or misfortune to its inmates--are stillheard traversing the air, though they are seldom seen.Tales of the Hand of Glory--that unhallowed taper made of the hand of ahanged man, holding a candle made of the fat of a murderer, whose lightwould send all the inhabitants of a house to sleep, and enable a burglarto make his easy way throughout it--are still told.And the Fairy Hills near Castleton, Hetton-le-Hole, Middridge, and otherplaces where fairies used to dance their nightly rounds, are stillpointed out. Cattle were often shot by their tiny arrows, and childrenfrequently wore necklaces of coral or of peony seeds, as otherwise theymight have been stolen and taken away to Fairyland.Mr. Henderson, in his _Folk-lore of the Northern Counties_, is convincedthat there is firm faith in ghosts and their power of revisiting theearth throughout the whole county of Durham.Witchcraft is to some extent believed in. It is not long since an oldwoman reputed to be a witch died at Aycliffe, and charms against theirpower have been, and are still, practised; indeed, they are still\"crossed-out\" by those who make the sign of the cross on loaves beforethey are put in the oven, and by the butchers who make, or used to make,a cross on the shoulder before selling it. A crooked sixpence, a pieceof rowan-wood, or a four-leaved clover worn in the pocket, will keepthem away. A self-bored stone or a horseshoe hung over the bed or in thebyre will prevent their evil influence from harming either person orproperty; and should you be so unfortunate as to meet a reputed witch,it is well to close your fingers round your thumb, and repeat the rhyme:    \"Witchy, witchy, I defy thee,     Let me go quietly by thee!\"And there were wise men, and especially wise women, who knew many spellsof might to be used against them and against fairies.It is clear that a child born into this haunted country, and surroundedfrom his birth by signs, portents, and auguries, must carry through hislife a belief in the superstitions of his forefathers.The day of birth is most important, for it always influences thecharacter and fortunes of the child.    \"Monday’s child is fair of face,     Tuesday’s child is full of grace,     Wednesday’s child is full of woe,     Thursday’s child has far to go,     Friday’s child is loving and giving,     Saturday’s child works hard for its living;     But the child that’s born on Sabbath-day     Is wise and bonny and good and gay.\"Children born during the hour after midnight see spirits, and thisuncanny gift continues through life. If born with a caul, the child willalways be lucky. Children born in May are said to be seldom healthy.A cake and cheese should always be provided before the birth of aninfant. These are cut by the doctor, and all present partake of them, onpain of the poor child growing up ugly. The nurse keeps some of thiscake and cheese, and when she takes the child to be christened she givesthem to the first person whom she meets of opposite sex to that of thechild. If boys and girls are being christened at the same time, the boysmust be christened first, as otherwise the girls would have beards, theboys none!Baptism is thought to be good for a child, and it is often said thatchildren never thrive till they are christened. It is well if they cryduring the ceremony, for it means that \"the devil is going out of them.\"There is some warrant for this belief, for until the time of Edward VI.a form of exorcism, in order to expel the evil spirit from the child,was still used in the Baptismal Service.A child who does not cry at baptism will not live.It is unlucky to call a child by its future name until it has actuallyreceived it, and most especially should one avoid naming it after a deadbrother or sister. The child will probably die also, or, if it lives,will never prosper.Some nurses will never put a child’s dress over its head until it ischristened, but always draw it up over the feet. I never could hear why.And the inside of the hands should not be washed during this time. Somego so far as to say that the right hand should not be washed for a year,so as not to \"wash the luck away.\"But before taking a child out of its mother’s room the careful nursewill see that it does not go downstairs first, as that would mean adescent in life for it. If it is impossible for it to go upstairs, shemust take it in her arms, and mount a chair or stool with it, therebyassuring it of a rise in life.The mother should go nowhere till she has been churched, as she wouldcarry ill-luck to the house she entered.The baby should receive three, sometimes four, presents when it firstvisits another house. These are its \"almison,\" and consist of an egg,bread, salt, and sometimes a piece of money. The bread and salt arethings used in sacrifices; the egg has always been a sacred emblem; themoney is for luck, and should be carefully kept.Never rock a cradle when empty, or you may rock another baby into it.And this is very likely to be the case if the reigning baby cuts itsteeth very early, for, as the proverb says, \"Soon teeth, soon toes\"(another set of them). If it tooths first in the upper jaw, that meansdeath in infancy. Later, on losing a tooth, the cavity should be filledwith salt, and the tooth thrown into the fire with the words:    \"Fire, fire, burn bane,     God send me my tooth again!\"It is an ancient custom, when a family is sold up, to except the cradle,and leave it in the possession of its original owner.The nails should not be cut for a year, or the child will become athief. Bite them off, and all will be well.When the child grows older, the nails should never be cut on Friday orSunday. These are unlucky days, but, as the rhyme tells us, other daysdo very well:    \"Cut them on Monday, cut them for health;     Cut them on Tuesday, cut them for wealth;     Cut them on Wednesday, cut them for news;     Cut them on Thursday, a pair of new shoes;     Cut them on Friday, cut them for sorrow;     Cut them on Saturday, a present to-morrow;     But he who on Sunday cuts his horn,     Better that he had ne’er been born!\"Still later in life, another verse says:    \"Sunday shaven, Sunday shorn,     Better hadst thou ne’er been born!\"The hair should always be cut when the moon is waxing, and all clippingsand combings should be burnt, or \"the birds will take it for theirnests.\" Probably the original idea, like that attached to the clippingsof the nails, was that they should be destroyed, lest some enemy shoulduse them to work an evil spell against the owner.If the hair burn brightly when thrown into the fire, it means long lifeto the owner; if it smoulder, it is a sign of death.If you swallow a hair, it will wrap itself round your heart and killyou. Howitt tells this seriously as having caused the death of HerbertSouthey.The mother should be careful to see that no child is allowed to jumpover the head of another, as in that case the overleapt infant wouldnever grow. The Kafirs have the same idea, and some tribes will not playleap-frog for that reason.When a seventh son is born, it is still said that he ought to be adoctor. He was anciently supposed to be able to cure the \"king’s evil\"by touching; and the seventh son of a seventh son had still higher andmore Divine attributes. If a seventh daughter appeared without any boyintervening, she was to be a witch.When the boy is old enough to put his instilled and inherited beliefsinto practice, he may charm the butterfly to alight on his hand bysaying (it must be said often enough!):    \"Le, la let, ma bonnie pet!\"If he wishes for fine weather, he may sing:    \"Rain, rain, go to Spain!     Fair weather come again!\"The snail will look out from its shell if he says:    \"Snail, snail, come out of your hole,     Or else I’ll beat you as black as a coal!\"And when stung by a nettle, dock-leaves are laid on the stung place, andthis rhyme chanted:    \"Nettle in, dock out;     Dock in, nettle out;     Nettle in, dock out;     Dock rub nettle out!\"If he puts a horse-hair into water, it will turn into an eel.Durham schoolboys used, when they saw a rainbow, to make a cross ofstraws or twigs upon the ground, in order to send it away, or, as theysaid, to \"cross out the rainbow.\"Borrow tells of \"the gipsy mystery of the trus’hul, how by making across of two sticks the expert in occultism could wipe the rainbow outof the heavens\"; and the charm might have its roots still farther backin the cross of Thor, anciently used to dispel rain and thunderstorms.In Confirmation, those who are touched by the Bishop’s left hand willnever marry.When the time for marriage comes, it is important to choose a lucky dayand season. The days of the week are thus fated:    \"Monday for wealth, Tuesday for health,       Wednesday the best day of all;     Thursday for losses, Friday for crosses,       And Saturday no luck at all.\"It is well to avoid marriage in Lent, for    \"If you marry in Lent,     You’ll live to repent.\"And May is an unlucky month for weddings, as for births. But the timebeing happily settled, the bride must not hear the banns given out, orher children will be deaf and dumb, and neither she nor any of theguests must wear anything green. She should wear    \"Something old, something new,     Something borrowed, and something blue.\"The day of the marriage should be fine, \"for happy is the bride whom thesun shines on.\" The bridal party is escorted to church by men armed withguns, which they continually fire. After the ceremony it is theclergyman’s privilege to kiss the bride; and outside the church peopleare probably waiting with \"hot-pots,\" of which the whole party musttaste.At St. Helen’s Auckland, and other villages, the \"race for thebride-door\" for a ribbon or kerchief is still customary.And it was formerly the custom to address complimentary verses to thebridal couple before they left the church. This was called \"saying theNominy.\" The verses differed, were of no great poetical merit, andalways ended with, \"Pray remember the Nominy sayer.\"The word is evidently derived from _nomen_, the bride having received anew name.The loss of the wedding-ring means the loss of the husband’s love, andits breaking forbodes death.Of portents of death there are many. The howling of dogs; the flight ofjackdaws or swallows down the chimney; \"a winding-sheet\" in the candle;the crowing of a cock at the dead of night; the hovering of birds roundthe house, or their resting on the window-sill, or flapping against thepane; and three raps given by an invisible hand, are all auguries ofdeath.If thirteen persons sit down to a meal together, one of them will diebefore the year is out.The custom of keeping the Vigil of St. Mark is not unknown. They whowish to know who of their fellow-parishioners will die during the comingyear must keep watch in the church porch from eleven to one, on St.Mark’s Eve, for three successive years; then the doomed company willpass into the church. But if the watcher fall asleep during his vigil,he will himself die during the year.At the time of death the door should be left open to afford free passageto the departing spirit. It is held that no one can die on a bed orpillow containing the feathers of pigeons or of game of any kind; andall along the East Coast it is said that people usually die during thefalling of the tide.When the corpse is \"laid out,\" the death-chamber is shrouded in white,the clock is stopped, and the looking-glass covered, to show that forthe dead time is no more and earthly vanity departed. There is also thedread that if the mirror were left uncovered the ghost of the dead manmight be reflected in it.A plate of salt is also placed upon the breast as an emblem of eternity.Those who come to see the corpse are expected to touch it, in token thatthey are in peace with the dead. It is often said that if you do nottouch it you will dream of it. The coffin must be carried to the churchby the old-established \"church-road,\" and the notion still prevails thatthe way over which a body is carried to its burial thereby becomes ahighroad. Therefore in the case of private roads or bridges (thePrebend’s Bridge at Durham, certainly) a small toll is levied when afuneral procession passes over it. The coffin-bearers are usually chosenso as to correspond with the deceased in sex, age, and position. In thecase of children and young girls, white scarves and gloves are worn; andif the dead person were a young unmarried woman, a \"maiden garland\" usedto be laid on the coffin, and hung up in the church after the funeral.There are, or were, some of these garlands hanging in the church ofWitton-Gilbert, near Durham. These have a glove, cut out of white paper,in the midst.When arrived at the churchyard, the dead must be carried to the gravethe way of the sun (east, by south, west, and north, for \"ye wad no haethem carry the dead again the sun; the dead maun aye go wi’ the sun.\"This is an old British usage, and in the Highlands is called \"making thedeisul.\" It is practised to bring good luck; to go round in the oppositedirection (or \"withershins\") is an evil incantation, and bringsill-fortune.It should rain a little during the procession, for \"happy is the corpsethat the rain rains on!\"It used to be customary for anyone meeting a funeral to stop for amoment and take his hat off. This is still occasionally done.The survivors should not grieve too much for the dead, as this hinderstheir repose.When the head of a house dies, the bees should be told of their master’sdeath, and asked to accept the new one, or they will all die.It is said that if a loaf of bread weighted with quicksilver be allowedto float in the water, it will swim towards, and stand over the placewhere the body of a drowned person lies.There is a remedy for most diseases in the shape of a spell or charm.Whooping-cough may be cured by passing the child under an ass; or bytaking some milk, giving half to a white ferret, letting the child drinkthe rest. In Sunderland, the crown of the head is shaved and the hairhung upon a bush, so that the birds, carrying it to their nests, maytake the cough with it.For epilepsy, a half-crown may be offered at Communion and then askedfor again, and made into a ring to be worn by the person affected.For cramp, garter the left leg below the knee, or tie an eel’s skinround it.A more unpleasant remedy is that for a wen, for the touch of a corpse’shand will cure it. \"Andrew Mills’s stob\" (gibbet) was once thoughtsovereign against toothache.Warts can be charmed away by taking a piece of raw meat (it ought to bestolen), rubbing the warts with it, and throwing it away. As the meatdecays the warts will vanish.If anyone is bitten by a dog, the animal should be destroyed, for,should it go mad at any time, the person bitten would be attacked byhydrophobia.St. Agnes’s Fast (January 21) is thus practised: Two girls, each wishingto see their future husbands, must fast and be dumb through the whole ofSt. Agnes’s Eve. At night, in the same silence, they must make \"the dumbcake,\" aided by their friends, then divide it in two parts, one of whicheach girl takes, walks backwards upstairs, cuts the cake, and retires tobed. Then dreams of the future husband should follow.And girls will stick a candle-end full of pins to bring their lovers tothem. Or, taking an apple-pip, and naming the lover, will put it in thefire. If it burst with a noise he loves, but if it burns silently hislove is nought.If a girl wishes to meet her future husband, she must carry an ash-leafhaving an even tip, and say--    \"The even ash-leaf in my hand,     The first I meet shall be my man.\"If it is found difficult to rear calves, the leg of one of the deadanimals should be hung in the chimney. In Yorkshire, the dead calf isburied under the threshold of the byre, either practice being(unconsciously) a sacrifice to Odin.\"To work as though one was working for need-fire,\" is a common proverbin the North, and refers to the practice of producing fire by thefriction of two pieces of wood. This was done when the murrain prevailedamong cattle, and the diseased animals were made to pass through thesmoke raised by this holy fire. This was considered a certain cure. Whencattle have foul in the feet, the turf on which the beast treads withthe affected foot is taken up and hung in the open air. As it crumblesaway, so will the diseased foot recover.And the water in which Irish and other stones have been steeped has beenused in the Bishopric as a cure for disease for cattle.If you seize the opportunities, which are many, you may have what youplease by wishing for it. But the condition is in every case the same:the nature of the wish must be kept secret. You may journey to Jarrow,and sitting in Bede’s chair, make your wish; or, nearer at hand, thereis a stone seat at Finchale Priory credited with the same power. If yousee a horseshoe or a nail, pick it up, throw it over your left shoulderand wish; and wish also if you see a piebald horse, but you must manageto do so before you see its tail.You may wish, too, when you first hear the cuckoo, and when you see thenew moon.Much reverence has in all ages been paid to wells. The Worm Well atLambton was once in high repute as a wishing-well, and a crooked pin(the usual tribute of the \"wishers\") may be sometimes still discoveredsparkling among the clear gravel of the bottom of the basin.As late as 1740 children troubled with any infirmity were brought to theVenerable Bede’s Well, at Monkton, near Jarrow. A crooked pin was putin, and the well laved dry between each dipping.Pins may sometimes be seen in Lady Byron’s Well at Seaham. There was acustom (which cannot now be practised, as the monument is railed in) ofwalking nine times round Neville’s Cross. \"Then if you stoop down, andlay your head to the turf, you’ll hear the noise of the battle and theclash of the armour.\"The weather-wise will tell you that if the leaves remain long upon thetrees in autumn it is going to be a hard winter, and will bid you noticehow the wind blows on New Year’s Eve:    \"If on New Year’s Eve the night wind blow south,     It betokeneth warmth and growth;     If west, much milk and fish in the sea;     If north, much cold and storms there will be;     If east, the trees will bear much fruit;     If north-east, flee it, man and brute.\"Candlemas Day (February 2) should also be observed:    \"If Candlemas Day be fair and bright,     Winter will have another flight;     If Candlemas Day be clouds and rain,     Winter is gone, and will not come again.\"Some pretend to prophesy the coming weather from that of the last threedays of March. These are called the \"borrowing days.\"    \"March borrowed from April     Three days and they war ill;     The first o’ them war wind and weet,     The next o’ them war snaw and sleet,     The last o’ them war wind and rain,     Which gar’d the silly puir ewes come hirpling hame.\"Of Michaelmas Day it is said: \"So many days old the moon is onMichaelmas Day, so many floods after.\"If it rains on Friday it is sure to rain on Sunday--“wet Friday, wetSunday.\"Watch the cat as she washes her face, and if she passes her paw over herear it will rain to-morrow.The oak and ash-trees are considered to prophesy the weather:    \"If the oak bud before the ash,     We shall be sure to have a splash;     But if the ash bud before the oak,     We shall have weather as hard as a rock.\"If you will begin the year auspiciously, be careful that your first foot\"is a fair man.\" Men still go about to \"bring the New Year in,\" andtheir guerdon is usually a glass of whisky. On no account should a womanbe the first foot, for she would bring misfortune. But before this theNew Year has been ushered in by the ringing of church bells, andsounding of buzzers from all the collieries.Nothing should be allowed to go out of the house on this day, for thatwould mean a year of poverty, but as much as possible should be broughtin, as that will insure a year of plenty; and for the same reason a newdress should be worn with money in its pocket.Be careful to avoid seeing the first moon of the year through glass;courtesy to her, and wish.The day before Shrove Tuesday is known as Collop Monday, and on it eggsand bacon should be eaten.Pancakes, of course, are appropriate to Shrove Tuesday; in fact, it isbetter known in the North as Pancake Tuesday. Durham children stillbelieve that on this day pancakes fall out of the mouth of the greatmedieval knocker fixed on the north door of the cathedral, and aresometimes seen bringing plates or baskets to receive the dole, and sugarwith which to eat it.The Pancake Bell still rings from the cathedral to call the faithful toconfession, though neither confessional nor pancakes are existent.Football usually begins now and continues till Easter.Carlings, or grey peas soaked in water and fried in butter, are eaten onCarling Sunday.\"He who hath not a palm in his hand on Palm Sunday must have his handcut off,\" so \"palm crosses\" were always made for Palm Sunday of willowcatkins, tied up with ribbon, and kept till next year.On Good Friday \"hot cross buns,\" a sort of teacake made with spice andsugar, and marked with a cross, are always made; and fig pudding, or\"fig sue,\" is eaten, in memory of the fig-tree cursed by our Lord whenHe rode to Jerusalem.No blacksmith in the county of Durham would at one time drive a nail onthis day, in memory of our Lord’s crucifixion.Good Friday and Easter Sunday were both thought lucky days on which tocast the coats and caps of young children, or to short-coat them.You must put on something new on Easter Sunday, or the birds will spoilyour clothes.Paste-eggs boiled hard and dyed with ribbons or wool, whinblossoms oronion peelings, are rolled on the grass, or \"jauped\" against each othertill broken, and tansy puddings should be eaten.Balls are often given to children and played with by them, this being arelic of the custom of playing at \"handball\" at Easter.On Easter Sunday the boys may pull off the girls’ shoes; but on EasterMonday the girls may retaliate by pulling off the caps of the boys.\"All Fools’ Day\" is still kept to some extent, chiefly by schoolboys,who send their victims to the chemist for oil of hazel, or \"strap oil,\"which they receive in a dry form from the irate shop-keeper!They also wear oak-leaves on Royal Oak Day; and the choristers ofDurham Cathedral go to the top of the central tower and sing anthems.This, though now done in honour of the Restoration, was originally inthanksgiving for the victory of Neville’s Cross, and used to take placein October.And it is schoolboys, too, who keep Guy Fawkes’ Day in remembrance, forthe noise of crackers and fireworks and the excitement of a bonfire dovery much appeal to them. Guys are now seldom carried about, but aresometimes burnt.The \"mell-supper\" in the county of Durham (from the Norse _melr_, corn)is akin to the Northumbrian \"kirn-feast,\" and is held when the lastsheaf is brought in. When this is done, the farmer’s headman proceeds to\"shout the mell\":    \"Blest be the day that Christ was born.     We’ve getten mell o’ Mr. ----’s corn.     Weel won and better shorn.            Hip, hip, hip, huzza, huzza!\"This last sheaf used to be dressed in finery and crowned with wheatears,hoisted on a pole, and all the harvesters danced round this \"kern-baby,\"or harvest-queen, who afterward presided over the supper. Mummers, or\"guisers,\" used to attend the feast, but all these usages are dying out,and the master often gives the harvesters money or ale instead of thesupper. This is the old autumn feast of the ingathering of the corn, andin Brito-Roman times the image was that of the goddess Ceridwen,answering to Ceres. Later, it stood for the Virgin Mary.You must not gather brambles after October, or the devil will come afteryou! He is evidently about at this time, for when the brambles arespoilt at the end of the season, it is said that \"the devil has set hisfoot on the bummelkites,\" this being their local name.Hallow E’en sports are still practised, the mystic apple so oftenappearing in Celtic fairy-lore, playing a great part in them. Applesare ducked for in a tub of water with the mouth, the hands being claspedbehind the back. A small rod of wood is sometimes suspended from theceiling, a lighted candle being fixed at one end, and an apple at theother. The apple has to be caught by the teeth when it passes beforethem, and if it is carefully pared, so that the peel comes off in onestrip, and this is flung over the left shoulder, it will form theinitials of the loved one’s name. Or it may be eaten before a mirror,and the lover’s face will be reflected therein; but on no account mustthe worker of this spell look backwards.At Christmas-tide Yule cakes and \"Yule dollies\" are made, these lastbeing quaint figures made of dough, with currants to mark their featuresand the outlines of their dress. Furmety (wheat boiled in milk) iseaten, the Yule log is burnt, and the Christmas stocking is hung up thatgifts may be placed in it. Candles are still given by grocers; thefruiterer presents a bunch of mistletoe; children come round and singcarols, bearing a box containing figures of the Virgin and Child. Thesword-dancers or \"guisers\" come, perform a dance and sing a song, thewords of which vary considerably.Finally, as many mince-pies as you eat at Christmas, so many happymonths will you have.Here is \"a copious catalogue of things lucky and unlucky,\" at least ofthose considered as such in the Bishopric:If you accidentally put on a stocking, or indeed any garment, insideout, it is most fortunate, and the mistake should not be rectified, youwill turn the luck.But if you put a button or hook into the wrong hole while dressing inthe morning, something unpleasant will happen to you during the day.\"Sing before breakfast, cry before supper,\" is an oft-quoted proverb,perhaps deduced from the common belief that unusually high spiritsportend coming misfortune.When a child first puts on a dress with a pocket in it, its fathershould put some money into it; this means lifelong riches.On putting on a new dress, a well-wisher will say to the owner, \"I wishyou health to wear it, strength to tear it, and money to buy another.\"Similarly, when a young tradesman first dons his apron, it is well tosay to him: \"Weel may ye brook your apron.\" This, if said by a luckyperson, will insure the young man’s success in life.If a spider is found on the clothes, it means that money is coming toyou; and if clothes must be mended while being worn, you will losemoney.If the hem of your dress persistently turns up, a letter is coming toyou.If your apron falls off, someone is thinking of you.Those who can always guess the time accurately will never be married.If the nose itches, you will be annoyed; if the foot, you will travel.Itching of the right hand, money is coming to you; of the left, that youwill have to pay money; of the ear, hearing sudden news.If the right ear tingles, someone is defaming you.If you shiver, someone is walking over your grave.A blessing is still invoked on people when they sneeze.Meeting eyebrows are fortunate; so is a mole on the neck, at least, itmeans health to the owner, but some say that it brings him in danger ofhanging.Always enter a house with your right foot first; to enter with the leftfoot brings ill luck to the inhabitants, and you must go back and repairthe mistake.If you stumble, by accident, in going upstairs, you will be married thesame year; the same if you snuff out the candle (this omen is becomingrarer with the decline of tallow candles).If two people wash their hands in the same basin, they are sure toquarrel before bedtime, but this may be prevented by making the sign ofthe cross over the water.If your eyes are weak, have your ears pierced, it will benefit them.If a loaf be turned upside down after cutting, it is unlucky. Along thecoast they say that it causes a ship to be wrecked. The same if threecandles are placed upon the table.If a loaf breaks in the hand while cutting it, you part man and wife.And spilling the salt is as ominous here as elsewhere, but you may amendyour luck by throwing a pinch three times over your left shoulder withyour right hand.\"Help me to saut, help me to sorrow,\" would be the answer to the personwho should offer to place salt on the plate of another.To cross the knife and fork is a sign of bad luck. To give a knife cutslove; it should always be paid for. Only last Christmas I gave a knifeto an old friend, and she punctiliously sent a penny to me in paymentfor it.Do not lend a pin, your friend may take one, but it is unlucky to giveit.Never begin anything on Friday, it will not prosper.If you must pass under a ladder, cross your fingers and wish. Theunsophisticated spit; and if you are walking with anyone wait for him tospeak first, and any ill luck that may be coming will fall on his head.\"Spitting for luck\" is still common enough. Hucksters and fish-womenspit on the handsel (the first money they receive), and manyhorsedealers do the same. Colliers, when considering a strike, used tospit on one stone together, by way of cementing their confederacy, andschoolboys used to spit their faith when making a challenge to fight.This was considered a sacred pledge which it was thought a point ofhonour to fulfil.It is wrong to point at the stars, or even to count them; you may bestruck dead for doing so.Hawthorn blossoms should not be brought into the house; they are asunlucky as peacock’s feathers, which also should never be broughtindoors.And evergreens should not be burnt.    \"If you burn green,     Your sorrow’s soon seen.\"The luck of three is much believed in. If you fail twice in trying to doa thing, you will probably succeed in the third trial. \"The third time’scatchy time.\"Servants say that if they break one thing they are sure to break three,a foreboding which not seldom comes true.And when the minute-bell of the cathedral rings once it is bound to ringthree times.If you break a looking-glass, you will have no luck for seven years.Some say that it betokens a death in the house, probably that of itsmaster.If a black cat enters the house, it must by no means be turned away, forit brings good luck.    \"Wherever the cat of the house is black,     The lasses of lovers will have no lack.\"Kittens born in May are unlucky and useless, never keep them.It is lucky, when you see the first lamb of the year, if its head isturned towards you; but unlucky, if its tail.It is thought that hedgehogs suck cows as they lie asleep.A toad is poisonous; do not touch it.In all ages the flight and behaviour of birds have been thought worthyof notice.When setting hens, the number of eggs should be odd (generally eleven orthirteen); if the number be even, you will have no chickens. A hen thatcrows brings ill luck, just as does a woman who whistles.If the hens come into the house, or if the cock crows on the threshold,a visitor is coming. If you have money in your pocket and turn it whenyou first hear the cuckoo you will be rich all that year; but if yourpocket be empty so it will remain. There is a small bird attending onthe cuckoo, generally a meadow-pipit. It is called in Durham thecuckoo’s sandy, and is supposed to provide its patron with food.When the peacock screams, it is going to rain.The magpie is an unlucky bird because it would not go into the ark withNoah, but sat outside, \"jabbering at the drowned world.\"    \"One is sorrow, two mirth,     Three a wedding, four a birth,     Five heaven, six hell,     Seven the de’il’s ain sel’!\"But if you have the misfortune to see one magpie you may nullify theomen by making the sign of the cross, or, as some do, by waving a handat the evil bird, and saying, \"Mag, I defy thee.\"The raven is thought to be an unlucky bird, though here in Durham citywe should think better of it, for one made the fortune of Sir John Duckby dropping a gold piece at his feet when he was a poor out-of-workbutcher-boy. He became a rich coal-owner, and in his memory coals areoften called \"ducks\" in Durham; and the \"Old Duck Main\" still exists atRainton.If rooks, or crows, as we call them here, desert a rookery, it means thedownfall of the family on whose property it is. Swallows, once sacred tothe Penates, and honoured as the heralds of the spring, are lucky, andtheir nests must never be pulled down, as they bring good fortune to theplace where they build, and it bodes ill luck if they leave a place theyhave once tenanted.Naturally, much local lore has gathered round the cathedral, the greatMother-Church of the diocese. The death superstition relating to theminute-bell, the ringing of the Pancake Bell, and the legend of theknocker, have already been mentioned. The Curfew Bell still rings atnine (the hour of compline), not at eight, as in other places, butnever on Saturday, because on the night of that day a man, who wentalone to ring, was spirited away, and never seen again.When, on May 29, the choristers go to the central tower, they singanthems on three sides only, and except the western side, because it wasfrom this point that the man leaped whose tombstone is seen below. It isa mutilated effigy of Frosterly marble, and is said to represent Hob ofPelaw, holding the purse of money for which he risked and lost his life,and the fossils in the marble are said, by schoolboys, to be the coinscontained in it. Country people come, for some unknown reason, to drawtheir foot over the purse.Curiously, the churchyard here is on the north side of the church. Thecloisters are ceiled with Irish oak, so that they never harbour dust orcobwebs, and the saying goes that if the Protestants were not alwaysdoing something to the cathedral the Catholics could take it away fromthem!There is no church at Butterby, and you will often hear a man who is notin the habit of attending Divine worship spoken of as a \"Butterbychurchgoer.\"These old-world beliefs and stories are fast fading away before theadvance of the schoolmaster; but they linger yet in the minds of oldpeople, and it will be long before they are quite forgotten.[Illustration: THE PALACE GREEN, DURHAM.]THE LEGENDS[6] OF DURHAMBY MISS FLORENCE N. COCKBURNThe northern counties are all rich in legendary history, and the countyof Durham has its full share.Curiously, instead of most of the legends being of an ecclesiasticalnature, as one would naturally expect in a county where the Church haspredominated for many centuries, the contrary is the case. All thebest-known legends are of deadly war waged with some uncouth orvenomous monster, in which, without exception, some local hero,Jack-the-Giant-Killer-like, comes off victorious._The Dun Cow._Visitors to Durham rarely leave without having the sculptured panelrepresenting the famous Dun Cow on the cathedral front pointed out tothem.The legend runs that the monks, having fled from Chester-le-Street andrested with the body of the saint for some time at Ripon, were desirousof returning to Chester. \"Coming with him (St. Cuthbert) on the eastside of Durham to a place called Ward-lawe, they could not with alltheir force remove his body from thence, which seemed to be fastened tothe ground, which strange and unexpected accident wrought greatadmiration in the heart of the bishops, monks, and their associates,and, ergo, they fasted and prayed three days with great reverence anddevotion, desiring to know by revelation what they should do with theholy body of St. Cuthbert, which thing was granted unto them, andtherein they were directed to carry him to Dunholme (Durham). But beingdistressed because they were ignorant where Dunholme was, see their goodfortune. As they were going a woman that lacked her cow did call aloudto her companion to know if she did not see her, who answered with aloud voice that her cow was in Dunholme, a happy and heavenly echo tothe distressed monks, who by that means were at the end of theirjourney, where they should find a resting-place for the body of theirhonoured saint.\"[Illustration: THE DUN COW.]_The Brawn of Brancepeth._At what time the brawn, or boar, ceased to exist as a wild animal inBritain is uncertain, but it was at one time a common inhabitant of ourBritish forests, and protected by the law in the tenth and eleventhcenturies.The village of Brancepeth (a corruption of Brawn’s path) is said to havederived its name from a formidable brawn of vast size, which made hislair on Brandon Hill, and walked the forest in ancient times, and was aterror to all the inhabitants from the Wear to the Gaunless. Themarshy, and then woody, vale extending from Croxdale to Ferry Wood wasone of the brawn’s favourite haunts. According to tradition, Hodge ofFerry, after carefully marking the boar’s track near Cleves Cross, dug apitfall, slightly covered with boughs and turf, and then, toiling on hisvictim by some bait to the treacherous spot, stood, armed with his goodsword, across the pitfall--“at once with hope and fear his heartrebounds.\"At length the gallant brute came trotting on its onward path, and,seeing the passage barred, rushed headlong on the vile pitfall to meetits death. It is generally believed that this champion of Cleves sleepsin Merrington churchyard, beneath a coffin-shaped stone, rudelysculptured with the instruments of the victory--a sword and spade oneach side of a cross.Another stone, supposed to be the remnant of a cross, stands on the hillnear the farm of Cleves Cross, and is said to have probably been raisedon the same occasion. It was not unusual, in England or abroad, when aman had slain a boar, wolf, or spotted pard, to bear the animal as anensign in his shield. We believe that the seal of Roger de Ferry stillremains in the treasury at Durham, exhibiting his old antagonist, a boarpassant. The seal of his daughter Maud, wife of Alan of Merrington,shows the boar’s head erased._The Pollard Boar._A family of the name of Pollard was seated at an early period in theparish of Bishop Auckland; and one of their estates was called Pollard’sDene, and the ceremony of presenting a falchion to the Bishop soon afterhis entrance into the See was performed by the possessors of Pollard’slands.The legend of how a Pollard gained this land runs as follows:The King offered to anyone who would bring the head of a wild boar,which destroyed man and beast, to his palace \"a princely guerdon,\" andthe Bishop of Durham, who passed the greater part of the year atAuckland Castle, having also promised a large reward, a member of theancient family of Pollard determined to kill the brute, or die in theattempt. So this courageous knight armed himself, mounted his trustysteed, and rode to the lair of the boar, and noted its track. Aftertying his horse to a tree, out of its regular course, he climbed abeech-tree under which the monster often passed, and shook down a largequantity of ripe beechmast.There he waited until the boar came, and had the satisfaction of seeingit make a good meal. In time it showed signs of drowsiness, andcommenced moving from the place. Pollard, feeling that the time had comefor action, made an onslaught on the boar. After so hearty a meal, itwas not in a fighting humour, but nevertheless made a fierce resistance,and taxed to the utmost the prowess of the knight. The encounter lastedthe greater part of the night, and the welcome rays of the sun burstforth as he severed the head from the trunk of the boar. Having cut outits tongue and placed it in his wallet, he decided to rest for a shorttime under a tree; but a deep sleep overcame him, and led to a seriousdisappointment, for when he awoke he discovered that the head had beentaken away. He was in great despair, for he had not the trophy to taketo the King to obtain the promised prize; so, mounting his horse, herode to the Bishop and told his tale, and, showing the tongue, hislordship, who was about to dine, rejoiced to hear the good news, and, asa reward, promised the knight as much land as he could ride round duringthe hour of dinner. When he next came before the prelate, he startledthe latter by intimating that he had ridden round his castle, andclaimed it and all it contained as his meed. The Bishop was loath topart with his stronghold, but was bound to admit the validity of theclaim, and eventually made a compromise by granting him an extensivefreehold estate known to this day as Pollard’s Land. These broad acreswere given with the condition attached that the possessor should meetevery Bishop of Durham on his first coming to Auckland, and present tohim a falchion with this speech: \"My lord, I, in behalf of myself aswell as several others, possessors of the Pollard’s lands, do humblypresent your lordship with this falchion, at your first coming here,wherewith, as the tradition goeth, he slew of old a mighty boar, whichdid much harm to man and beast; and by performing this service we holdour lands.\"Hutchinson, rather curiously, quotes a letter signed \"R. Bowser,\"commencing: \"Sir, inclosed you have the speech my brother Pewterer gaveme out of Lord Bishop Cosin’s old Book,\" in which the boar is describedas \"a venomous serpent.\"Dr. Longley, created Bishop of Durham in the year 1856, was the lastBishop to whom the falchion was presented.The crest of the Pollard family is an arm holding a falchion. As to themissing head, it is related that while Pollard slept the head of theNorthumbrian family of Mitford passed, saw what had occurred, seized thehead, and rode with all speed to the King, and gained the reward. Thechampion Pollard also sought an interview with His Majesty, and givingthe facts, showed that the head presented had not a tongue; he was,however, dismissed without any recompense, the King declining toentertain a second claim.There is in the parish church of St. Andrew’s Auckland an old woodeneffigy representing a knight in a suit of chain armour, cross-legged,with his feet resting on a boar, and it is generally believed that thismonument was erected in memory of our hero.In sequel it should perhaps be added that the Mitfords have for manycenturies borne as their crest two arms holding a sword pierced throughthe head of a boar; and as a commentary, perhaps, upon the principlethat fortune[Illustration: HILTON CASTLE FROM THE NORTH.]helps those who help themselves, they flaunt the pious motto:                       GOD + CARYTHE + FOR + US._The Cau’d Lad of Hilton._The grey old castle of Hilton has long had the reputation of beinghaunted by a bar-guest, or local spirit, known as the \"cau’d lad ofHilton,\" or \"cowed lad of Hilton.\" His history, however, seems to berather mixed, and to partake of the nature of the genuine ghost as wellas that of a brownie. This brownie was seldom seen, but often heardengaged in playing pranks in the great hall, or in the kitchen after theservants had retired for the night. If they left the kitchen orderly andclean, the brownie, angered at having his work taken out of his hands,would throw all the crockery and kitchen utensils about the room, sothat when the servants appeared in the morning a picture of confusionmet their eyes. Of course, as a rule, they found it worked best not toattempt to leave things tidy, and then the brownie would exert himselfthrough the night, and all would be straight and clean for the maidswhen they rose.The servants, however, engaged by the last Baron thought his pranksrather wearisome, and determined to attempt his banishment by the usualmeans employed in such cases--that is, by leaving for his express usesome article of clothing, or some toothsome delicacy to tempt hispalate. They resorted to a green cloak and hood as the best means ofdriving him away. However, the brownie knew what they were after, andmany a time during the making of the cloak and hood could be heardsinging in the dead of night--    \"Wae’s me, wae’s me!     The acorn is not yet     Grown upon the tree,     That’s to grow the wood,     That’s to make the cradle,     That’s to rock the bairn,     That’s to grow the man,     That’s to lay me.\"The green cloak and hood were finished at length; the servants laid themdown before the fire in the great kitchen, and watched at a prudentdistance. At midnight the \"cau’d lad\" glided in, surveyed the garments,put them on, frisked about, and when the cock crew disappeared, saying--    \"Here’s a cloak and there’s a hood:     The Cau’d Lad of Hilton will do no more good.\"And so disappeared for ever.The appearance of this brownie seems to have been confused with anotherghost.The apparition of a boy who was killed by one of the Barons often usedto be seen--sometimes, it is said, with his head under his arm.A Baron of Hilton, many years ago, ordered his horse to be got ready. Hewas a passionate man, and a fearsome one to cross. The stable-boyfoolishly fell asleep. For awhile the lord waited for his horse, andthen, in a lively temper, went off to the stable and found the sleepingboy. He struck the boy with a hay-fork and killed him there and then.Horrified at what he had done, he covered the body with straw tillnight, and then threw it into a pond at the south side of the park,where, many years afterwards, the skeleton of a boy was discovered. Soruns the legend.It is interesting to note that a boy named Roger Skelton was killed byRobert Hilton, a brother of the then Baron, in July, 1609.[7]There was a haunted room in the castle called the \"cau’d lad’s room,\"which was never used. Here, it is said, the spirit of the murdered boymade its residence. For many years there has been no appearance of theghost, though there are persons who affirm that, if they have notactually seen it, they have heard it about the castle._The Lambton Worm._In Plantagenet days the Lord of Lambton had a godless son, whodesecrated the Sabbath by fishing in the Wear, and while so doing hehooked a strange worm with nine breathing-holes on either side of itsthroat. This queer find he threw into a well near by, since known as\"the Worm Well,\" and here the worm grew until it was too large for thewell. It then emerged, and betook itself by day to the river, where itlay coiled round a rock in the middle of the stream, and by night to aneighbouring hill, round whose base it would twine itself. Meanwhile itcontinued to grow so fast that it soon could encircle the hill threetimes. This hill, which is on the north side of the Wear, and about amile and a half from old Lambton Hall, is oval in shape and still calledthe Worm Hill. In the meantime the heir of Lambton had turned over a newleaf, and departed as a Crusader to the Holy Land. The worm still grew,and came daily ravaging for food. The milk of nine cows hardly sufficedit for a meal, and if this were not forthcoming it slayed both man andbeast. Many knights tried their prowess against the worm, but with noavail, for no sooner was the worm cut in two than the pieces grewtogether again. The poor Lord of Lambton was in sore trouble when, afterseven long years, the heir of Lambton returned home, a much sadder andwiser man. Seeing the result of his former evil practices, he determinedto kill the enormous beast. Several attempts he made without success,because the parts would come together whenever he cut it in two. At lasthe consulted a witch of the neighbourhood, and she told him if he cameto the fight clothed in armour studded with razors, and stood in theswift stream, he would conquer; but that he, like Jephthah, must killthe first living creature that met him after the victory. So to meetthis latter difficulty he told his old father to listen, and when hegained the victory he would blow three notes upon his bugle, then hisfather was to loosen his favourite greyhound, which would come to thebugle’s call.Having made all preparations, the heir started on his mission. Standingin midstream, he waited the onset of the worm. It came, and seeing itsenemy, wound itself about him; but as it tightened its hold, the razorscut it into many pieces, which, falling into the water, were swept awayby the current, and so were unable to grow together again. Thus thevictory was won, and the bugle sounded; but the old lord, overjoyed atthe thought of his son’s victory, forgot to let loose the hound, and ranhimself to meet the conqueror. Here now arose a difficulty; the sonwould not be a parricide. He went again to the witch, and she told himthat the only alternative was the doom that none of his family shoulddie a peaceful death, to the seventh, or some say the ninth, generation.Tradition sayeth that this alternative was accepted, and that no head ofthe family died on his bed for several centuries after.There are two stone figures of some antiquity preserved at LambtonCastle. One of these is apparently an effigy of our hero in the middleof the fray, only the worm has ears, legs, and a pair of wings. Theother figure is a female one, and marked by no very characteristicfeatures._The Sockburn Worm._The legend of the Sockburn worm is very similar to that of the Pollardboar. It is recorded in an old manuscript that Sir John Conyers, knight,slew a monstrous and poisonous wyvern, or worm, which had devoured manypeople in fight, for the scent of the poison was so strong no personcould stand it. But before making this enterprise,[Illustration: LAMBTON CASTLE IN 1835.]having but one son, he went to the church of Sockburn in completearmour, and offered up his only son to the Holy Ghost. The place wherethis great serpent lay was called Graystane. The gray stone is stillpointed out in a field near the church. For more than six hundred yearsthe manor of Sockburn was held by the singular service of presenting afalchion to the Bishop of Durham on his first entering the diocese, andit was the duty of the Lord of the Manor of Sockburn, or hisrepresentative, to meet His Grace at the middle of Sockburn Ford, or onCroft Bridge, which spans the River Tees, and after hailing him CountPalatine and Earl of Sadberge, to present him with a falchion, saying:\"My Lord Bishop, I here present you with the falchion wherewith thechampion Conyers slew the worm, dragon, or fiery flying serpent whichdestroyed man, woman, and child, in memory of which the King thenreigning gave him the manor of Sockburn, to hold by this tenure, thatupon the first entrance of every Bishop into the county this falchionshould be presented.\" The Bishop, after receiving the weapon in hishand, promptly and politely returned it, and at the same time wished theLord of Sockburn health and a long enjoyment of the manor.This ceremony was last performed in April, 1826, when the steward of SirEdward Blackett, the Lord of Sockburn Manor, met, on Croft Bridge, Dr.Van Mildert, the last Prince-Bishop of Durham. The tenure is mentionedin the inquisition post-mortem held on the death of Sir John Conyers inthe year 1396. The falchion was formerly kept at the manor-house ofSockburn: the blade is broad, and 2 feet 5 inches long, and on thepommel of the weapon, which is of bronze, are two shields; on one sideare the three lions of England, as borne by the Plantagenet monarchsfrom John to Edward III., and the eagle displayed on the other side issaid to belong to Morcar, the Saxon Earl of Northumberland. This relicwas also represented on one of the stained-glass windows of SockburnChurch. On a marble monument, placed to the memory of an old member ofthe Conyers family, the serpent and falchion were sculptured._The Pickled Parson._The present rectory house at Sedgefield, erected by the Rev. George,Viscount Barrington, was preceded by a castellated edifice, which, afterserving the purpose of a rectory house for some years, was burnt down in1792. During a lengthened period previous to the destruction of the oldhouse the inhabitants of Sedgefield appear to have been greatlydisturbed by the visits of an apparition known as the \"Pickled Parson,\"which, it was confidently declared, wandered in the neighbourhood of therector’s hall, \"making night hideous.\" Whose wandering shade the ghostwas supposed to have been is explained as follows: A rector’s wife hadthe ill-luck to lose her husband about a week before the farmer’s tithesfell due. Prompted by avarice, she cunningly concealed his death bysalting the body of her departed spouse, and retaining it in a privateroom. Her scheme succeeded, she received the emoluments of the living,and the next day made the decease of the rector public._The Picktree Brag._Picktree, near Chester-le-Street, is famous for two reasons--first,because it was the home of the heroine of the popular song, \"AilsieMarley,\" and, secondly, because it was the haunt of one of thosemischievous goblins known as the Picktree Brag. Sir Cuthbert Sharp givesan account of the apparition, as told by an old woman of respectableappearance, of about ninety years of age, living near the spot, probablyat Pelton. The old woman said: \"I never saw the Brag distinctly, but Ifrequently heard it. It sometimes appeared like a calf with a whitehandkerchief about its neck, and a bushy tail. It came also like agalloway, but more often like a coach-horse, and went trotting along thelonnin, afore folks, settin’ up a great nicker and a whinney every nowand then; and it came frequently like a dickass, and it always stoppedat the pond at the four lonnin ends, and nickered and whinnied. Mybrother saw it like four men holding up a white sheet. I saw then surethat some near relation was going to die, which was true. My husbandonce saw it in the image of a naked man without a head. I knew a man ofthe name of Bewick that was so frightened that he hanged himself forfear on’t. Whenever the midwife was sent for it always came up with herin the shape of a galloway. Dr. Harrison wouldn’t believe in it, but hemet it one night as he was going home, and it ’maist killed him; but henever would tell what happened, and didn’t like to talk about it, andwhenever the Brag was mentioned he sat tremblin’ and shakin’ by thefireside. My husband had a white suit of clothes, and the first time heever put them on he met the Brag, and never had them on afterwards buthe met with some misfortune; and once when he met the Brag, and he hadhis white suit on (being a bold man), and having been at a christening,he was determined to get on the Brag’s back, but when he came to thefour lonnin ends the Brag joggled him so sore that he could hardly keephis seat, and at last it threw him off into the middle of the pond, andthen ran away, setting up a great nicker and laugh, just for all theworld like a Christian. But this I know to be true of my own knowledge,that when my father was dying the Brag was heard coming up the lonninlike a coach and six, and it stood before the house, and the roomshaked, and it gave a terrible yell when my father died, and then itwent chatterin’ and gallopin’ down the lonnin as if yeben and yerth wascomin’ together.\"These northern ghosts or goblins have been very well described in thefollowing verse attributed to Ben Jonson:    \"Sometimes I meete them like a man,       Sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound,     And to a horse I turn me can,       To trip and trot about them round.         But if to ride         My backe they stride,     More swift than wind away I go;         O’er hedge and lands,         Through pools and ponds,     I whirrey laughing, ho, ho, ho!\"NAME-PLACES IN THE DURHAM DALESBY WILLIAM MORLEY EGGLESTONEWhen Julius Cæsar conquered Britain, he found the island peopled byCelts--a branch of the great family of nations called the Aryan, orIndo-European, which spread over the world from Central Asia. TheWestern branches, which rolled in successive waves over Europe, includedthe Celts, who, according to the Greek traveller Pytheas, were in thefourth century before the Christian era quite at home in Britain, for hethere saw growing in the fields corn which the farmers took in sheavesto the barns, in which were threshing-floors.In Weardale, situated in the western and mountainous part of the countyof Durham, and surrounded by brown and heath-clad fells, the ancientBriton lived in the limestone caves, and hunted in the oaken forests. Inthe Wear Valley, near Hamsterley, and about seven miles east ofStanhope, there is a remarkable relic of the ancient Britons. Thisancient fortification--like many other works constructed by the Britonsof old, such as the Dene Holes of Essex and the Cliff Castles--has itsname, and is called The Castles. The treasure of Heatheryburn Cave, atStanhope, consisted of bone knives and pins, boar tusks, bronze and jetornaments, spearheads and bronze celts, with prehistoric human skulls,showing considerable activity of the natives who manufactured and formedthe various rude implements. Apart from these landmarks, there have comedown to us in names of places the Celtic roots the _ray_ and the _tay_,which we find in Lang Tay, the name of a small but long tributary streamof water in Burnhope; and in Reahope, a tributary hope to Stanhope, andwhich empties its waters into Stanhope Burn, a tributary of the RiverWear.The Roman power seems to have been extended to Weardale, for the twoRoman altars found at Bolihope and Eastgate, and the denarii found atWestgate, prove that this lead-mining dale was well known to thoseruling and wall-building people.Soon after the Romans left, the Anglo-Saxons--including the Jutes, theSaxons, and the English--established themselves along the eastern coastof Britain, and these tribes of the Teutonic family took a firm grasp ofthe land, and planted the roots of the English nation.Though little more in the early Saxon period than a dense forest, inwhich wild animals and ancient Britons found shelter, Weardaleultimately became an Anglo-Saxon district, influenced by the blending ofthe Scandinavian element in dialect and names of places, owing to itsproximity to the Danelagh on the south, and the Norwegian settlement inCumberland on the west. The whole of the Palatinate appears to haveremained Saxon through the Danish rule except the northern banks of theTees. We know little of Weardale at this period. Situated amidstmountains, and lying next the Strathclyde, it was probably as muchCeltic as Saxon; but the division of counties, however, was made in 953by the Saxon Edred, or Eadred, and the Weardale people would know theircounty, for, on the bleak and heather-clad fell of Burnhope, the limitsof the Palatinate is marked by a pile of stones, called \"eadestones\"--evidently King Eadred’s stones--the boundary established bythat Saxon monarch. Weardale and Teesdale, however, under the power ofthe Normans, were destined to be turned into desolate wastes; yet, as weshall see, the Saxon names of places survived the desolation of fire andsword.If we examine the names of places in the Bishopric of Durham a centuryor so after the Danish rule had ceased and the Norman rule had beenestablished, we shall find a large percentage of Saxon suffixes. In theBoldon Buke, A.D. 1183, there are some 151 names of manors, wards,vills, etc., in which, with a few other names in charters of about thesame period, we have 45 endings, or suffixes, in 175 names of places.The Anglo-Saxon test-word, _ton_, figures in no less than 34 of theseprincipal names of places: as Darlington, a settlement of the Deorlings;Stockton, the stockaded town; Haughton, the haugh town; Morton, the moortown; Norton, the north town; Essington, the home or settlement of theEssings, as the Herrings gave a name to Herrington. Of the other Saxonsuffices we have: _ley_ 25, _burn_ 14, _don_ 8, _worth_ 6, _ford_ and_ham_ 5 each; and the Celtic _hope_, common in the Anglo-Saxon North,occurs 8 times. Thus, 8 endings take up 105 of the names of places inBoldon Buke, the remaining 70 names having 37 endings. The Danishtest-words, _by_ and _thorpe_, only occur once each--Killerby and Thorp.These names do not show that the Vikings made permanent settlementsnorth of the Tees. In Teesdale we find in Domesday Book, A.D. 1086,Lontune, Mickleton, Lertinton, and Codrestune, having the Saxon ending_tun_ or _ton_; but though the names of these places were English, theplaces themselves were, or had been, belonging to a Dane, for they werethen in the hands of Bodin, and had formerly been Torfin’s--a personnamed from the Scandinavian god Thunder, or Thor. Hundredestoft andRochebi have the Danish _toft_ and _by_, and, like many other names,such as Thorsgill and Balders Dale, point to the influence and power ofthe Scandinavians and their heathen worship in the neighbouring dale ofthe Tees.In the five northern counties, Worsaae returns Danish-Norwegianplace-names in the following order: Westmorland 158, Cumberland 142,Durham 23, Northumberland 22, and Yorkshire in its three Ridings 405.The ending _by_ occurs 167 times in Yorkshire, and _thorpe_ 95 times;whilst 7 of each are ascribed to Durham, and but 1 of the latter only toNorthumberland. Yorkshire, however, on a closer inquiry, shows over 250names of places containing the element _by_, and over 160 of that of_thorpe_, the former predominating in the North and West, and the latterin the East and West Ridings. Of the 83 names ending in the Norwegiantest-word _thwaite_, as mentioned by Worsaae, 80 occur in the northerndistrict, Yorkshire 9, Lancashire 14, Westmorland 14, and in NorwegianCumberland 43, whilst there are no _thwaites_ in Durham orNorthumberland. The evidence adduced from names of places thus goes toprove that the Angles of Durham and Northumberland, though under theyoke of the Danes during the ascendancy of the Scandinavian power, have,from their first settlement, continued on their adopted soil through allthe vicissitudes incident to the descents of the Britons from thewestern mountains, the inroads of the Picts and Scots, the ravages ofthe Vikings, and the subduing marches of the powerful William ofNormandy.Northumbria, as of old, may be divided into two provinces in respect toits place-names--Deira, the district of the Danes, and Bernicia, thedistrict of the Angles, the central boundary-line being the River Tees.The Norse _beck_ and Anglo-Saxon _burn_ distinctively mark this linebetween these districts in the upper reaches of the valleys of the Wearand Tees. The mountain-range from Burnhope Seat, at the western confinesof Durham, eastward to Paw Law Pike, forms the south division betweenthe parishes of Stanhope in Weardale and Middleton in Teesdale. Theprincipal tributaries of the Tees, on the south of this ridge, are_becks_, whilst those on the Wear side are _burns_. In Weardale, at thenorth-western extremity, Scraith _Burn_ and Langtay _Burn_ contribute toBurnhope _Burn_. On the Tees side, rising within half a mile or so ofthe above burns, Ashgill _Beck_ contributes its waters to Harewood_Beck_. Farther eastward we have Harthope _Burn_ on the Weardale side,and Harthope _Beck_, which runs into Langdon _Beck_, on the Teesdaleside, both streams rising on Harthope Fell, and within a few yards ofeach other.Continuing eastward, we find several _becks_ on the southern border ofthe county of Durham. In 1672 a Teesdale stream was named Raygill Burn,having the Celtic _ray_, the Norse _gill_, and the Saxon _burn_. In theadjoining parish of Wolsingham, in the Wear valley, nearly all thetributaries are named _becks_ in the Ordnance map, but these are, withone or two exceptions, originally all _burns_. In an old document ofQueen Elizabeth’s time we find in this parish, Wascrow _Burn_,Westerharehope _Burn_, Hadderly Clough _Burn_, Houselop _Burn_, Bradley_Burn_, Collier _Beck_ and Ells _Beck_. There do not appear to be morethan two _becks_ in this parish, Ells Beck and Holbeck, the latter asmall runner near Holbeck House, the home of the Craggs family, one ofwhom was the Right Hon. James Craggs, Secretary of State.In the Wolsingham names of streams that of Wascrow is generally nowcalled Waskerley; its real name, however, appears to be Westcrau, from_crau_, a crag or rock, and _west_; or its adjectival component might be_wæs_, water. Houselop is Ouselhope, the hope of the _Ousel_ or _Ouse_,Welsh _wysg_, Erse _uisge_, water. Ouse is a common river name.Having so many Anglo-Saxon names of places in the eastern part of theBishopric of Durham, it is natural to suppose that the settled familiesof the Angles would send offshoots along the banks of the Wear, up intothe dale where the river had its source. Wolsingham--the Saxonmetropolis of Weardale, for its ancient manor included the whole of theWear valley westward--is the _ham_ or home of the sons or descendants ofa family of Franks, represented in Kemble’s English settlement names inWælsingas, and in the German Walasingas, a family who probably settledin the South of England and sent their sons to the North, for Durham,according to Taylor, contained no original Anglo-Saxon settlements.East of Wolsingham but a few miles is Witton, the _ton_, or town ofwitness, Anglo-Saxon _witena-gemot_. North of Weardale lie Hunstanworthand Edmundbyres, so the dale of the Wear is surrounded by towns havingthe Anglo-Saxon suffixes, _ton_, _ham_, and _worth_, except the Danish_byre_ of St. Edmund.Along the banks of the Wear, three miles west of Wolsingham, is situatedthe village of Frosterley. Here early settlers appear to have had anabode on the banks of the river. The present name of the village isevidently derived from the forest or foresters of the Bishops of Durham,who resided here to manage the great forest westward, but theScandinavian personal name, Frosti, is worthy of consideration. Thereappears, however, to have been a far earlier settlement here. A verysmall enclosure near the river-side is named Bottlingham, but not avestige of a settlement remains, and the name of the small plot ofground is all that is now left. Bolihope, a tributary valley to theWear, and which empties its burn into the river a hundred yards or twobelow the place under consideration, was called, in Bishop Bec’s time,Bothelinghopp. In these two names we have the _hope_ and the _ham_ ofsome Anglo-Saxon settlers, named Pottel, which by the law of interchangemight become Bottel. Bodvulf, who died in 655, was canonized, havingfounded the monastery of Ikano. This saint’s relics were dispersed,hence several churches are dedicated to St. Botolph, and Bottlebridge isSt. Botolph’s bridge. The old chapel at Frosterley was, according totradition, dedicated to St. Botolph, and close to the chapel site thereis Bot’s Well, a name which would appear to confirm the local traditionin respect to the dedication.Stanhope, too, with its Anglo-Saxon initial syllable _stan_, a stone,and Celtic _hope_, had an older settlement in all probability than thepresent town, which takes its name from the adjoining Hope, which isfull of rocks or stones. At the west end of Stanhope town there is asmall stream called Allerton Burn, which gathers its waters nearAllerton Riggs, lying north-west of Stanhope. The stream joins the HopeBurn, near Stanhope Hall, but where is Allerton? which is, or was, the_ton_ or town beside the allers or alders, or more probably the enclosedplace of some Saxon named Alder or Ealder, from Anglo-Saxon _ald_, old,and _hari_, warrior. The site of this place was most likely nearAllerton Bridge at Stanhope Hall, and this old hall residence--the seatof the Fetherston-halghs, from the days of King Stephen--probablyrepresents the spot which we are in search of; it occupies a tongue ofland between the confluence of the Allerton and Stanhope Burns.Seven hundred years ago, persons bearing the Saxon names of Osbert,Ethelred, Meldred, Goda, Aldred, Collan, and others, held lands atStanhope, and did service under the Bishops of Durham.Considering the close proximity of the principal Danish settlement inEngland, that of Yorkshire, it would not be surprising if an inquiryinto local names of places revealed the fact that the followers ofOdin’s prophetic raven had left a footprint of some value in the Durhamdales. The most remarkable, if not unique, footprint of the adventurousNorthmen is preserved in the word _thing_, pronounced _ting_, which innames of parishes and places points out the localities where theVikings, in their days of rule, held their outdoor national assemblies,and promulgated their national laws.When the daring Northmen touched the shores of England, subdued in theyear 867 Northumbria, and set up Inguar, the first Danish King, asruler, they brought with them, and implanted, their traditions andcustoms.In Weardale there is a Thimbleby Hill, on the south side of the Wear,opposite Stanhope, and if the Danes were in this dale for the purposeof assembling a _thing_ or council, this hill is the one above allothers which they would have chosen. It has on the top a considerableflat, and it overlooks Stanhope Town on the north, commands a mostexcellent view down the valley eastward, and up the valley westward,whilst to the south lies a rising heath-covered ridge. The position ofthe hill would at once recommend itself to the Danes, who always tookcare to have their national courts held in places which would be freefrom surprise; and it is possible that Shield Ash represents theshealings of ash bows, erected for the accommodation of those attendingthe court. Stanhope is in Darlington _Wapentake_, which word is Danish,and each wapentake had its court or _thing_. Presuming that the Danesheld a council at Stanhope, they do not appear to have establishedthemselves to any extent; but, as we find the Danish _toft_, as in ToftWell, and a place in Bolihope, named in Hatfield’s Survey Turpenstanes,the boundary stones of _Thorfinn_, a Danish personal name, and that inA.D. 1183 persons holding the Scandinavian names of Russell, Thore,Arkil, and a son of Turkill, held lands at Stanhope, it would not be amatter of surprise if a Danish council did take place in Weardale, whichis situated so close to the Danish district, and which was under therule of the first Danish King in England.One of the most striking instances of the Norwegian element in Weardale,is what was fifty or sixty years ago the \"national\" winter sport of thedale. This was _skeeing_, the national sport of Norway. Within thememory of a few of the oldest inhabitants no snowy winter passed inWeardale without this sport being practised to its full extent.In the mountainous district of Weardale, one of the most important Northof England rivers is cradled, and into this isolated highland dale theCeltic name of the Durham river has penetrated. Almost all the Englishrivers have retained the names given to them by the Celts, and _avon_,_dur_, _esk_, _rhe_, and _don_, are Celtic roots repeated, over and overagain, in names of streams, not only in England, but on the Continent.In the name Nent Water, in Cumberland, we have the simple name \"water,\"and the Cymric _nant_, a hollow or valley formed by water--a common namein Wales. Writers mention Nant Lle as+ the vale of Lle; Nant Gwyrfai,the vale of fresh water; Nant Frangon, the beavers’ hollow or ravine;and Pennant, the head of the valley. The little village Nenthead, on thewestern slope of Killhope, is the head of the valley. From the root_dwr_, water, and the frequently occurring Celtic _gwent_, an openregion, comes Derwent, the name of the stream on the north of Weardale,and of various other rivers in England. The local pronunciation,however, in the district of Derwent is _Darwen_, which suggests _dwr_and _gwen_, the clear water.The River Wear is formed by the joint streams of Killhope and BurnhopeBurns, which meet at Wearhead village. Its course through the dale israpid, receiving many tributaries from the hopes. On reaching Aucklandit takes a north-easterly course. \"And now,\" says Camden, \"the river, asthough it proposed to make an island, compasseth almost on every sidethe chief city of this province standing on an hill, whence the Saxonsgave it the name _Dunholm_. For as you may gather out of Bede, they callan hill _dun_, and a river island _holme_.\" The Wear, which enters thesea at Sunderland, was called _Vedra_ by Ptolemy, _Wirus_ by Bede, andin Bishop Pudsey’s time (1153-94) the name was written _Were_, the sameas we find in Hatfield, 1380, Holinshed 1577, and Camden 1604. Thelatter form is the proper modern spelling up to about the last century,when _Were_ became _Wear_, the present form of the name of St.Cuthbert’s stream. Ferguson, on the authority of Pott, gives theSanscrit _ud_, _udon_, water, from which comes the German _wasser_,English _water_, as the root of Ptolemy’s _Vedra_.[8] _Wirus_ suggeststhe Celtic _gwyrhe_, rapid water. Perhaps _gwy_ or _wy_, water, and_garw_ or _arw_, rough, form the roots. The former root enters into thenames of several rivers, as the Wye, Edwy, Elwy, and others. In all theforms of spelling the river-name of Durham the letter \"r\" isconspicuous. It is the principal one in _arw_, which enters into thenames of several streams--the Ayr, Are, Aire, Arre, being variations ofthis widely diffused root. The Welsh _rhe_, rapid, with _gwy_, may showequal claim to notice as first mentioned--namely, _gwyrhe_. Omitting theinitial _g_ in the first, and the middle letter in the second, root, wehave _wyre_.A _hope_ is a small opening running up to the mountain ridges as atributary to a main stream. From the burns again branch out _grains_,which, fed by springs, issue from _brocs_. The _cleugh_, _gill_, and_sike_, contribute their waters generally to the burns, whilst a _well_may come from a _dene_, and empty into the main stream. The westerndales of Durham are pre-eminently dales of _hopes_. This word is theCeltic _hwpp_, a slope or hollow between hills--a little dale in which astream of water gathers. These openings at the sides of the dale mayvery properly be termed places of refuge, places of shelter for animals,such as the deer, and in these days we find sheep located in the various_hopes_, where they have their _heft_--a locality to which they becomeattached; Anglo-Saxon _hæft_, from the having a holding or place. TheNorse _hop_ is a place of shelter or refuge. An inquiry into theBishop’s possessions of game in Weardale, nearly three hundred yearsago, particularly mentioned forests, parks, _hopes_ and pastures. Theplace-name _hope_ is common throughout the hilly parts of Durham,Northumberland, Yorkshire, and Derbyshire. In the neighbouring parish ofWolsingham there are Harehope, Ouselhope, and Thornhope; in AllendaleSwinhope, Sinderhope, Ellershope, and Mohope; the Boldon Buke records inthe Bishopric, Ayleshope, Rokehope, Cazhope, Refhope, Horsleyhope,Histeshope, Baldingehope, Burnhop, and Roueleiehope; and in Teesdale wehave Egleshope and Hudeshope. In Weardale we have the Hope, sometimescalled Stanhope Hope, probably to distinguish it from the town ofStanhope.In Weardale there are sixteen _hopes_, distinguished in name by somecharacteristic feature, as represented in their respective initialcomponents.Burnhope and Killhope, with Wellhope, are the three vales whichcontribute their streams to form the Wear at Wearhead. The initialcomponents _burn_, _kil_ and _wel_, are all Anglo-Saxon, meaning water,and have been given according to the custom of the early settlers. Fromthe head of the River Wear, the hopes, striking into the hillsencircling the head of the dale, are those out of which come water._Burn_hope is the hope of the burn, Anglo-Saxon _burne_, a stream;_Kill_hope is from Anglo-Saxon _keld_, a fountain; we have alsoIcelandic _keld_, Danish _kilde_, Norse _kill_, a fountain or brook;_Well_hope from Anglo-Saxon _wyl_, _wel_, a well or fountain--hence theyare all the hopes of water. _Kil_ is the Scotch and Irish word denotinga church, and if the situation had been favourable, and had there beenany evidence of a St. Godric having been located here, as at Wolsingham,we might have had the hope of the _kil_, kirk, or church, but in Camdenwe find _Kelhop_ and _Welhop_. Leland, at an earlier date, gives_Kelhope_ and _Welhop_, and Holinshed _Kellop_. Brocket says _keld_ is aword used in Yorkshire, Westmorland, and Cumberland, for a well orspring. Taylor gives _kell_ and _well_ as synonymous terms for a placefrom whence water flows. We read in Simeon of Durham of the Scots, inA.D. 1070, having marched through Cumberland and devastated Teesdale andthe parts bordering; then they came to the place called in English,Hundredeskelde--that is, \"the hundred springs.\" Barnard Castlewater-supply comes from a place called Spring Keld.One of the Bishopric knights at the Battle of Lewis was Sir HenryMerley, of Herkeld, in Witton; and Besanskeldes is a Boldon Bukeplace-name. We thus have, at the western confines of the county ofDurham, the hopes of water, and which pour forth their streams to formthe main river of the historic county of Durham.Ireshope, Middlehope, and Westernhope, derive their initial componentsfrom their position. _Middle_hope occupies a central position in theforest. The first tributary burn to the Wear after its formation is, ofcourse, the most western one, _Ire_shope, from Erse _iar_, the west.Snowhope, sheltered under the southern hills, retains patches of itswinter covering long enough, no doubt, to have warranted itsname--_Snawhope_, as it was formerly written, Anglo-Saxon _snaw_, Danish_snee_, German _schnee_, Belgic _sneeuw_--a name given to many mountainssubject to being covered in winter, as Snafell in Iceland, Sneekoppe inBohemia, Sneeuw Bergen at the Cape of Good Hope, Snee Hatten in Norway,Snafell in the Isle of Man, and Snowdon in Wales. In respect toIreshope, there is the Anglo-Saxon _yrfe_, _erfe_, _irfe_, inheritance,from the root _ar_; Old English _ear_, _earth_, as the _Ar_yan raceswere the tillers of the ground. There is also a root _ar_ applied torivers, as the _Ayr_, _Are_, and _Aire_: Welsh _araf_, gentle; Gaelic_ar_, slow; Celtic _arw_, violent--some of which might apply.Stanhope and Rookhope are characteristic names in a district of stoneand rock. In the Boldon Buke and Hatfield’s Survey we have Stanhope,Rokhop, and in the times of Bishop Beck, Stanehop, and Stanhop. Thefirst components in these names are from Anglo-Saxon _stan_, German_stein_, Icelandic _sten_, Danish _steen_, a stone; and Gaelic _roc_, amass of stone. The district is full of stones, as the many stone fenceswhich net the whole of the inlands and the higher lands to the moorstestify. From Boltsburn village the Rookhope stream runs over successiveedges of limestone and freestone, and culminates in a grand display byleaping over several picturesque linns at Eastgate.[Illustration: THE KEPIER HOSPITAL.]Two of the place-names, Harthope and Swinhope, carry us back to the wildbeasts of the forest. One was the lodging-ground or resort of the hartor stag, Anglo-Saxon _heort_; and the other gets its initial componentfrom Anglo-Saxon _swin_, _swyn_, a swine; Old German _suin_, traceableback to the Sanskrit _su_. The boar tusks found in Heatheryburn Cave,and the Roman altar at Stanhope Rectory, testify to Weardale being theabode of boars. The local word _aswin_, obliquely, Welsh _asswyn_, doesnot apply to this place-name. A far more probable etymology is theCeltic _swyn_, holy. Charnock is of opinion that the several riversnamed \"swine\" or \"swin\" may be from this root.Bolihope, the name of a considerable subvalley on the south ofFrosterley and Stanhope, is interesting, if not so easily explained. Thename is evidently associated with the district of Frosterley, where thestream from Bolihope enters the Wear. At this village we have asplace-names Bottlingham and Bot’s Well, and the ancient chapel is saidto have been dedicated to St. Botolph. Bishop Beck granted to WalterBerington twenty-seven acres of land in Bothelinghopp. The initialcomponent would suggest the Anglo-Saxon _botel_, _botl_, _botles_, anabode, mansion, or dwelling; also Norse _botl_, German _buttel_. Leo,however, says that very few Anglo-Saxon names of places are united withthis word. Bolton was formerly written Bodeltune. This, however, doesnot appear to be the etymon of the name in question, as _botel_ and_ham_, both Saxon for a dwelling, would not be found in one name. Alarge number of names of places have the Saxon patronymic _ing_, whichoften forms the medial syllable, such as Wolsingham, Darlington,Easington, Washington, Heighington, and, if the medial syllable of thename under consideration be the Saxon patronymic, then it is anAnglo-Saxon place-name--the home of the sons of some Saxon named Bottel.Bot is a Scandinavian personal name, but we find the Saxon Byttingas andPotingas, _Liber Vitæ_, Bota, and Frisian Botte. The personal namePottel--which by the law of interchange of initial letters might becomeBottel--would explain that the _hope_ and the _ham_ were belonging tothe son of some Saxon settler of this name, as elsewhere mentioned.Boltshope is a small offshoot from Rookhope. Bolt, as an iron-door bolt,is from Anglo-Saxon and Danish _bolt_, German _bolgen_, from the root_bole_, round as the bole of a tree. The Anglo-Saxon _bold_, _bolt_,originally _búld_, _búlt_, means a house or dwelling, an abode; Danish_bolig_; and we have mention made in Hatfield of Bold Shell in Rookhope.Boltsburn is the village of the Rookhope Valley, and is situated at thefoot of Boltshopeburn. At the top of the hope is Bolts Law, which isprobably the place earliest named, and in all probability is from apersonal name. Bold Shield would not be from the Anglo-Saxon _bold_, anabode, but is evidently Bold’s shield, the _shield_, or home, of Bold,as the eminence might be the _law_ of Bold or Bolt._Dene_ is from the Celto-Saxon _den_, a deep, wooded valley; Anglo-Saxon_den_, _dene_, _denn_. The best specimen of this kind of valley in thecounty of Durham is probably Castle Eden Dene, a wooded, narrow valleynear the sea. Its name is interesting, and contains the ancient andmodern spelling. Its earliest name was evidently Eden, from _ea_ or _e_,water, and _den_, a wooded valley; and this becoming a proper name, asecond _den_ was added--namely, Eden Dene, which gives uswater-dene-dene. We have also in the north Hesleden, Deneholm, andHardwick Dene._Burn_, _grain_, _broc_, are allied. The first of these may be said tobe as pure Weardale as Saxon. Whilst the Norse _beck_ crowds the banksof Teesdale, it does not exist in Weardale. _Burn_ spreads from thisdale northward through Durham, Northumberland, and Scotland. _Beck_ isas foreign to Weardale as the Danish test-word _by_ and the Norwegian_thwaite_, though all the three names crowd around, close to the veryhills on the south and west of the dale of the Wear. Within the boundsof Stanhope parish the Wear is fed by several tributary burns. Thesestreams receive or are formed at the head by _grains_, and the grainsare fed by springs from the _brocks_. _Brock_ is from Anglo-Saxon_broc_, _brece_, to break forth--the place where the water first breaksthrough the earth--hence _brook_, literally water running through theearth. A _brock_ is a little hollow a few feet wide, formed by waterbreaking through the ground, and washing out a miniature valley. Themoors of Weardale and surrounding district abound with these brokenplaces, which are mostly known to shepherds and game-shooters. Theyexist on the top of the fells, where they are the only natural shelters.Platey Brock, on Chapel Fell, receives its name from an exposed plate orshale bed. To show how numerous these places are, I will mention that onBurnhope Moor there are also Coldberry Brocks, Limestone Brocks,Highfield Brocks, Wester Langtayhead Brocks, Todsyke Brocks, LodgegillBrocks, Scraith Head Brocks, Browngill Brock, Cocklake Brock,Sally-Grain Brocks, Lang Brock. To the above may be added thebetter-known names of Black Brocks, or Moss Brocks, in Burnhope, andWelhope Brocks._Grain_, Icelandic _grein_, is a division, a branch, as the grain of afork; Danish _green_, a branch, a bough. Generally the branches at thehead of a burn are distinguished by north and south, and east and westgrains; and sometimes by name, as Sally Grain in Burnhope, and JoplaGrains in Bolihope. \"East Graine under Craggs\" is in Bolihope. AtHarthope Head there are the east and west grains, which meet and formthe burn. In addition to the sixteen hopes previously mentioned, fromtwelve of which flow the principal tributary burns to the Wear, thereare some thirty secondary streams, named _burn_, Anglo-Saxon _burne_, a_bourn_, stream, brook, river, and which are distinguished by the namesof the hope, or place, from which they flow, or from some othercharacteristic feature or condition.Sowen Burn, near Stanhope, is a very characteristic specimen, theadjectival component being the Old English _sounen_, sound, the noisyburn, or, rather, the sounding burn.Fine Burn, in Bolihope, is so named owing to the stream being a line ofboundary. The words \"fine,\" \"confines,\" \"finish,\" \"finis,\" mark the end,and the above stream is the boundary between the parishes of Stanhopeand Wolsingham. The Roman camp, _ad fines_ camps, is situated close tothe border-line between England and Scotland.In Rookhope Smails Burn implies the small burns--Anglo-Saxon _smala_,small--two little runners rendered somewhat historic in the days ofBorder broils, as we find in the old ballad of Rookhope Ryde. In thesame district we have Red Burn, and Over Red Burn. _Red_ is fromAnglo-Saxon _read_, _rud_; Danish _röd_, red, the red stream; or theCeltic _rhyd_, a ford; whilst _over_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _ofer_, ashore, or _ofer_, over, above or higher--hence High Redburn.Yeky Burn is from Anglo-Saxon _æc_, _eac_, oak, the stream of the oaks.There are two Heathery Burns, one associated with the noted cave atStanhope. Old spelling hetherie, hetherye, hethery, from heath,Anglo-Saxon _hæth_, Scotch heather.The name _well_ is given to a large number of tiny streams in Weardale.Dutch _wellen_, Anglo-Saxon _wel_, a fountain of water, and in Saxonnames of places, _wel_, _wyl_, and _well_ often occur.Kelhope and Welhope are literally the hopes out of which water _wells_.The source of the latter is named Wellheads. At the head of smallerwells there are _springs_, places where water springs out--Anglo-Saxon_springan_--hence we have such names as Spring Wells, Whitewell Spring,White Wells, White Springs.Ludwell is the people’s well, Anglo-Saxon _leod_, people. This watersprings out of a cave in the great limestone, where, in olden times, theWeardale folks might have congregated, for the Saxon prefix shows it tohave been the well of the people, like Ludlaw, the people’s hill,suggesting the days of village communities, and the days of superstitionwhen wells were in many cases held sacred. These were generally ironwells--locally, _haliwells_. There are many wells known as holywells inthis district, some of which are also termed _spa_-wells. This term isfrom the bath town, Spa, in Belgium, derived from _espa_.Of other wells proper, we might mention Sunderland Well, Hunterley Well,Huntshield Well, Black Dene Well, Carrbrow Well, Earnwell; Anglo-Saxon_earn_, _ern_, an eagle--the eagle’s well. Several names of places inEngland are from the eagle. Toft Well, east of Stanhope, is the well inthe toft or field, and the initial in Totley Well is probably from toft.Bot’s Well, at Frosterley, is supposed to be that of St. Botolph, towhich saint, the old chapel, close by the well, was dedicated. PoppetWell is a curious name, and is probably \"coppet,\" from _cop_, a head.The adjectival component in Duntert Well is evidently the same as inDunter Linn, at Eastgate. Boutes Well is Bolts Well, as in Boltsburn.Berry Well is apparently the well of the mountain, Anglo-Saxon _beorg_,_beorh_, a hill, a mountain. At Newhouse there is a Bank Spring, and atWestgate a Spring Bank, indicating at each place a bank and a spring ofwater. Cuthbert’s Spring, near Westgate, is in honour of the patronsaint of Durham, and it is no wonder that we find the name of St.Cuthbert associated with names of places. On Harthope Moor, and close tothe road, is an excellent spring called Jenny’s Meggie, and atFrosterley a spring is called Meggie._Cleugh_, _gill_, and _sike_ are associated with water. We have in theparish of Stanhope, in round numbers, 30 _cleughs_, 10 _gills_, and 70_sikes_. _Cleugh_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _clough_, a cleft down theside of a hill; Danish _kloft_; Norwegian _kliufa_, to split--a narrowravine more like a cleft in the hill than a water-worn valley. YearnCleugh, written _earne_ in 1666, is the eagle’s haunt, or that of thefalcon, the latter being once reared in Weardale for the purpose of theBishop’s hunt.In 1666 we find mention of Addercleugh, the adder being frequently foundin Weardale. Whick Cleugh--in 1595 written Weekerclough--is probablyfrom the Anglo-Saxon _wic_, a marsh, but more probably from _wice_, themountain ash, or rowan-tree, well known in the dale, and also known asthe wich-elm._Gill_ is from the Norse _gil_, a mountain chasm, a glen or fissure inthe hillside. For this name we are indebted to the Norwegians, whopeopled the neighbouring county of Cumberland. The best-known places ofthis class are Aller Gill, Lodge Gill, and Dry Gill, as being associatedwith habitations and lead mines. The first is the _gill_ of the alders.In Burnhope there is Lodge Gill, a well-known name owing to a oncefamous lead-mine being there situated. The name very probably originatedfrom some forest animal lodging there, as we find Lodge Field,Anglo-Saxon _logian_, to place, put, lodge--the field where probablydeer were lodged in the forest-hunting days of the princely Bishops ofDurham.In Burnhope, a lead-mine in 1666 was called Hesley Gill--the hazel gill.In Witton Gill we may have a very important place-name, for here may bethe gill of the witness--the spot where the inhabitants met, similar tothe meetings held in primitive times at particular stones. Leo says: \"Bythe names Wittan-ig, Wittan-mor, Wittan-mær, and Readan-stan, we areinformed of those national and provincial meetings for self-governmentwhich have always characterized our race.\" Anglo-Saxon _witan_, to know;Icelandic _vita_; German _wissen_, to know. The _Witena gemot_ Bosworthexplains as \"the assembly of the wise, the supreme council of thenation.\" Edred the Saxon King held a witan at Ginge, in the parish ofWest Hendred, Berks, and there is a Witan Dyke at Worthe in Hants,whilst in our valley there is the village of Witton-le-Wear. Mirke Gillin Bolihope is the dark gill from the Anglo-Saxon _myrc_, Icelandic_myrk_, dark. It is curious to notice how the Danish and Saxon _cleugh_,the Norwegian _gill_, and the Anglo-Saxon _burn_, are intermixed inRogerley-Gill-Burn, Willowgreen-Burn-Gill, and Stock-Gill-Cleugh; butsuch are many names of places, for if the term _burn_ was not understoodby a Norwegian settler, he would add his own term, _gill_; if this wasnot sufficiently clear to a Saxon, _burn_ would be added to convey hisown meaning of a mountain-stream, and in a similar manner the variousraces of mankind have stratified and built one upon another the variouscomponents of place-names which are ethnological and historicallandmarks too invaluable not to be closely investigated._Sike_ or _syke_ is a very common local name. It is from Anglo-Saxon_sic_, _sich_, Icelandic _sikje_, Norse _siki_. Sullivan says a _sike_is the drainage of a marsh, and that all sikes were once marshes.Natural productions have given names to several sikes, as the marshyhollows were the homes of trees, grasses, and animals; hence we haveRowantree Sike, where there is an excellent ironstone mine; Saugh Sike,two Aller Sikes, Rushy Sike, Bents Sike, Moss Sike, and Birk Sike. Wherewe find trees we find birds, so we have Hawk Sike, Hawk Sikes nearStanhope, and Snipe Sike. Todd Sike is where the fox haunted, and GoatSike wants no explanation. Chisholm Sike, Anglo-Saxon _ceosel_, _ceosl_,gravel, sand, the sike by the gravelly or sandy holm. In Teesdale thereis a Whey Sike, in Burnhope a Whoe Sike, and in Ireshope a Hoe Sike. InMiddlehope there is Scar Sike, the sike of the rock. Anglo-Saxon _carr_,Danish _skær_, Swedish _skar_, a projecting or prominent rock, acliff--as Scarborough, Scarthwaite, Scarcliff, and Scarsdale, written inDoomsday Book, Scarnesdele. At Middleton on the Tees there is a placecalled Skears, and _scarr_, _skarr_, _skire_, are forms found inplace-names. Whetstone Sike is where the whetstone sill is exposed.A _linn_ is a deep or still pool, from the Celtic _llyn_, water, a lake,flood; Anglo-Saxon _hlynna_, a brook. In the North of England, however,a _linn_ is understood to be a cascade or cataract, evidently owing tothe waterfall being a more attractive feature in a river scene than thelinn or pool, which is always found at the bottom of a fall. In Scotlanda _lin_, _lyn_, is described as a cataract, and in a secondary sense thepool below. In Ireland _lin_ is a pool; and the Icelandic form of theword is _lind_. The most attractive _linns_ in Weardale are Linnkirk, onShittlehope Burn, near Stanhope--a romantic spot where there is a tinywaterfall and a cave close by in the great limestone; the Dunter Linnand Holm Linn at Eastgate; and the Linny--a waterfall on the HarthopeBurn, near St. John’s Chapel. The Danish _dundre_ is to make a noiselike thunder, and the Scotch _dunder_ has the same meaning. The SaxonDonar is the god of thunder, hence Dunter Linn is that which makes agreat noise._Kern_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _cyrn_, _cyrin_, _cerene_; Danish_kjerne_, a churn; Icelandic _kirna_; Scottish _kirn_. The primarymeaning appears to be to turn, the act of turning, allied to quern, theancient mills for grinding corn. _Kern-holes_, found in the bed ofrivers, are holes worn out by the churning motion of water mixed withsand. On Chapel Fell there is a watery hole called Jackson’s Kern, owingto one Jackson being accidentally drowned in it whilst coming fromMiddleton; but this might be _cairn_, a heap of stones. In BurnhopeBurn, at Six-dargue, a deep hole in the stream is called Kern Pool._Pool_, Anglo-Saxon _pol_, Welsh _pwll_, Icelandic _pollr_. There are inthe Wear and its tributaries a large number of pools which have names.Holm Pool is the pool by the holm, and Wash Pool very probably was aplace where the good wives washed their linen in the days whenspinning, weaving, and various other methods of manufacturing householdrequisites were in full operation. Winn Pool, from the Anglo-Saxon_winn_, _gewin_, contest, struggle, to win--the pool where the meetingof the waters cause a fight, and struggle, as it were, to _win_.The _eale_ and _ealand_ are our isle and island, and are the names givenin Weardale to alluvial land on the margins of the main river. In theriver and place-names Gret_a_, _Ea_, _Ea_mont, Batters-_ea_,Aldern-_ey_, Pont-_eland_, _ea_ or _a_ represents water or a river.Bishop Egelwin, 1069, \"after having, with all his people, passed threemonths and some days at _Ealande_, returned to the church of Durham,\"according to the Saxon writers. In the Boldon Buke we find in a charterof Bishop Flambard--“R. Biscop greteth well all his thanes and drenghsof _Ealand_scire and Norhamscire.\" In Wolsingham parish we find inHatfield’s Survey, Papworth-ell, Small-eys, and in the same recordCatherine of the Ele is mentioned. The names of places containing theAnglo-Saxon root _ea_, in the parish of Stanhope, are about a dozen.In 1380, according to Hatfield, the parson of Stanhope held the Frith,and a place _parcellum del Ele_, containing one acre. In 1608, in a listof lands held by the rector of Stanhope, we find \"one close called ‘TheParson Ele.’\" A few hundreds of yards eastward, just below the Butts, wehave Bond Eale, a stretch of land subject to be flooded, and formerlyheld by bond tenants, who had to perform services in connection with theland, such as thatching and carrying the running gear for Stanhopecorn-mill.Thomas Morgan, by will dated 1641, left for charitable purposes amongstother lands: \"One parcel of arable ground in ye said Frosterley lyingand being at ye west end of ye same town in a place there called HudseEale, and one acre and a rood of ground lying and being in ye saidFrosterley in a place called ye Mille Eale, and all other my lands andtenements with ye said appurtenances in Frosterley aforesad--BarnesEale--excepted.\"A mile and a half west of Eastgate we have, between Hunterley Well andParkhouse Pasture, the interesting Cammock Eale, locally called \"CammoKeel,\" for the derivation of which we have the adjectival component fromthe Celtic _cam_, crooked, and the ending _og_, diminutive, Celtic_ock_--hence the little crooked isle._Holm_ is akin to ealand. Taylor says: \"The suffix in the name Durham isproperly not the Saxon _ham_, but the Norse _holm_; and Dunelm--thesignature of the Bishop--reminds us also that the Celtic prefix is_Dun_, a hill-fort, and not _Dur_, water. In the Saxon Chronicle thename is correctly written Dunholm.\" _Holm_ is also Anglo-Saxon, and isdescribed by Bosworth as \"a river island, a green plot of groundenvironed with water--hence holmes.\"Holmside, in the county of Durham, and Midge Holm, Holmwath, and YallowHolm, are names of places by the river in Teesdale.By the Wear, at the west end of Rogerley Park, is situated Burry Holm.In the year 1583 Thomas Blacket, Esq., of Woodcroft, demised to PeterMaddison, gent., three closes of land being part of Woodcroft estate;one close was on the west side of the low pasture, and another close ofmeadow was called \"Buiri Holme.\" It might be the holm of the burdock(_Arctium Lappa_), or the berry holm from Anglo-Saxon _berie_, _berige_,a berry, or the _bere_ holm or place where barley grew, Anglo-Saxon_bere_, barley. Again, the spear plume-thistle (_Cnicus lanceolatus_),called in Scotland the bur-thrissil, might flourish here, or theburtree, the common elder (_Sambucus nigra_).The names _flask_, _swang_, _bog_, and _wass_, indicate wet land, andare kindred terms to a certain extent. Those accustomed to travel on thehighlands of Weardale will be familiar with lands denominated _boggy_,_swampy_, _swangy_, _marshy_. The term _wass_ may be consideredobsolete, and that of _flask_ nearly so.In Hatfield’s Survey there were in Bolihope lands called the Wasses andSeggefeldland. _Wass_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _wæs_, water, and _segg_from the Anglo-Saxon _segg_, _seeg_, a reed or sedge, which commonlygrows on wet land.A pasture in Killhope, between Low Moss and the Rush, was some thirtyyears ago called the Flask. Langtay Flask is in Burnhope, and alead-mine here was known by that name 200 years ago. In the bailiffs’roll under Queryndon, we find in Hatfield, lands called _fennes_,_flasskes_, and a place called Atthillswang. In Quesshowe there was le_Flaske_. At Framwelgate, Broom cum le _Flassh_, at Cotam les _flaskes_._Bog_, Gaelic _bog_, Irish _bogach_, marsh, morass, quagmire, needslittle explanation. Riggy Bogs, Boghouse, White Bog, and Bog Hole, areamongst names of places in the dales._Den_, from the Celto-Saxon, is a deep wooded valley, and has alreadybeen considered under valleys. The most important _denes_ are EasterBlack Dene and Wester Black Dene.Hot Hill is no doubt the wooded hill, but Hotts has another derivation,and appears to be from _hut_, an abode or sheltered place. Another name,_hurst_, pure German, a thick wood, is confined, as far as Weardale isconcerned, to Shield Hurst.The termination _shaw_, a thicket or small wood, is frequently met within place-names. The Danish _skov_ is a wood or forest, Icelandic_skogr_; the Anglo-Saxon _scua_, _scuwa_ is a shade, the same as theSwedish _skugga_. Anglo-Saxon _sceaga_ seems to mean shaggy wood. In theHatfield’s Survey, a place in Bolihope is called Watteshawe--a wetwooded place. Near Allergill we have Birkshaw, the place shaded bybirch-trees. In Shittlehope there are two places on the expandingmoorlands called Bashaw and Mogshaw. The former was probably the badgershaw or wood. In the latter we have an important root, the Erse _magh_,Welsh _maes_, a plain. Taylor gives _magh_ as a Gadhelic test word, andsays that it is found in more than a hundred Irish names of places.The various place-names embracing _mea_, _may_, are from the same root,and probably Migg Clos, held by the parson of Stanhope in 1380, is akindred name. A place on the south side of Bolihope is namedHarnshaw--written in 1614 _Hornyshawe_, and in 1666 _Harnshaw_--fromAnglo-Saxon _hyrne_, _hirne_, an angle or corner, a resemblance to ahorn--hence the _hyrne_ shaw would be the horn-shaped wood. Ramshaw,particularly known for its well, is evidently the ram wood, Anglo-Saxon_ram_, _ramm_, a ram; but some authorities derive _ram_ from _raven_.These etymological conclusions give us a broad birch, a horn-shaped anda wet wood, a wood on a plain, and a wood frequented by the ram and thebadger._Wood_, Anglo-Saxon _wudu_, _wode_, woodland, enters into a few localnames, as Bradwode or Broadwood.In Rookhope there is a Foul Wood, a lead-mine so named over two hundredyears ago. Its name is evidently from the Anglo-Saxon _ful_, rotten, thesame as Foul Sike was the impure watercourse. In 1401 Roger Thorntonleased a lead-mine in Weardale at a place called Old Wode Clough.In _field_, _ley_, and _ridding_, we have indications of clearings inthe forest--places where cattle might feed. In Weardale there are somethirty _leys_, numerous _fields_ but very few _riddings_. The latterword is from Anglo-Saxon _hreddan_, to rid; _hredding_ a ridding; Danish_rydde_, to clear, grub up; _rydning_, clearing. The Weardale people arefamiliar with _rid-up_, a house; _rid-out_, a quarry; and similar terms.It is different from the _riding_, from Anglo-Saxon _thri_, _thry_,three; _thridda_, the third; _thrithing_, a third part of a province, asin the Yorkshire Ridings. Five hundred years ago John Migg held atStanhope four acres of land in the _Ridding_, Robert Todd held _jRidding_ over an acre, and Alexander Brancepath held five acres and onerod in the _Riddying_. In Queen Elizabeth’s time Michael Fetherstonhalghof Stanhope Hall purchased of Follinsby a parcel of ground calledPathemairidding. In Path-mairidding we have the ridding on the plainover which there was a path._Ley_, _lea_, _lee_, _lay_, is an open place, a pasture or field wherecattle may lie; from the Anglo-Saxon _leah_, _leag_, _lege_, _lea_,_leah_; from _licgan_, _liggan_, to lie. The _lea_ was an opening orforest clearing where cattle might be depastured, but where a good dealof woodland might exist. Gray, in the opening lines of his beautiful\"Elegy,\" sings--    \"The lowing herd winds slowly o’er the _lea_.\"This terminal occurs in over twenty names of places in Boldon Buke. InWeardale there are five names of places having this suffix which arevery important, as they give names to extensive stretches of land, andvery probably the adjectival components may all be derived from personalnames. These are Frosterley, Bishopley, Rogerley, Horsley, andBrotherlee.On the hill north of Eastgate is situated Bewley, where once a crossexisted, and in former days a watch for invaders was kept here. Thisplace-name is probably more correctly Bewdley. In 1380 and 1590 it waswritten _Bowdlye_, and may be derived from the Anglo-Saxon _bige_,_biga_, _bigan_, a turning, corner, bending, angle, the ley, or field,on the bend or bow of the hill, the bowed ley.Amongst the highest hills in Weardale are Fendrith Hill, KnoutberryHill, Noon Hill, St. Cuthbert’s Hill, and Horseshoe Hill. _Hill_, _hyl_,_hyll_, is Anglo-Saxon, Norse _holl_, a name given to large and smallelevations. One of these hills is named after the patron saint of theBishopric of St. Cuthbert. Like Outberry Plain on the southern ridge,Knoutberry Hill on the north, evidently derived its name from thecloud-berry, _Rubus Chamæmorus_, which grows on the Weardale fells. In1614, however, it was written Nookhill. Fendrith was written in 1539Fenrake. The word _rake_ is common in Weardale, and means to walk orrange, or the extent of the walk--hence a sheep-_rake_, Swedish _reka_,to travel, journey. A _fen_ is land covered with mud, a morass--hencethe Fenrake was the district covered by a large morass. The hill knownas the Horseshoe might be so shaped, or the suffix may be _shaw_, awood--the wood of Horsa.Amongst hills of lesser elevations than the five abovementioned areBilling Hills, where the Scots camped in 1327; Scaud Hill, in Burnhope,from the Anglo-Saxon _sceawian_, _scewian_, to look; Batable Hill,debatable land; Scrog Hill, Anglo-Saxon _scrob_, _scrobb_, a shrub, thehill of shrubs; Dun Hill, Ancient British _dun_, a height or hill fort(Gaelic _dun_, as Dun Fell, in Teesdale). Dod Hill and Dodder Hill aremountains with rounded summits, as Dodd Fell, in the Lake District.Cross Hill, in Stanhope, is where an ancient cross stood. We had a PaperHill and a Poperd Hill, which were the hills where the priests preached.We have hills known or distinguished as _hard_, _long_, _windy_,_slate_, _black_, _green_, _white_, _gold_, _quarrel_ (quarry), _hungry_(poor), _stony_, _great_, _low_, etc. Animals contribute their names, asin Hog Hill, Lamb Hill, Plover Hill, Fairhills (Norse _faar_, sheep),and Cowshill, the hill where cows congregated._Law_, Anglo-Saxon _hlaw_, _hlæw_, rising ground, an elevation, a hill.In the south it is _low_, as Ludlow, the people’s hill. Killhope Law is2,206 feet above sea-level, Collier Law 1,692, Bolts Law 1,772, and PowLaw and the Three Laws are the names of other hills in the district._Seat_, Anglo-Saxon _set_, a sitting; _sæta_, settlers, inhabitants. Theroot _sæte_, _set_, or _seta_, enters into several names of places inEngland, some of which are county towns, as Dorset, Somerset;Old Norse _setr_, a seat. The Norwegian _seter_ is a pasture ormountain-side--Burnhope Seat, Dora’s Seat, and Raven’s Seat. One was thesettlement of a person named Raven, or Rafn; the other that of Dora, orDore. In 1614 we find Dorry Sette. Bishop’s Seat was the place where thelords of the Bishopric settled when hunting in Weardale Forest. Anothername is Laverock Seat, evidently Leofric’s Seat, modernized intoLark-seat._Head_, Anglo-Saxon _head_, _heafod_, a head. In a district full ofundulating lands and small valleys there are several places derivingtheir names from being the top or head, or finished part of something,as Lanehead, Wearhead, Dalehead, Sidehead, Nag’s Head, Lamb’s Head, andothers._Rig_, _rigg_, Anglo-Saxon _rig_, _hrycg_, and various other forms;Danish _ryg_; Icelandic _hriggr_, a ridge, a back. Stangend Rigg is2,075 feet above sea-level._Plain_ and _pike_ are sufficiently expressive--the one a broad stretchof land, and the other a peak or pointed eminence. Five Pikes are nearPaw Law Pike, a south-eastern boundary point on the hills. IreshopePlains is a euphonious name; and Bewdley Plain, Sedling Plain, OutberryPlain, may be mentioned in the list._Moor_, _fell_, _common_, are well-known terms. Anglo-Saxon _mor_ iswaste-land, a moor, a heath; Danish _mor_ is a moor, or morass; we haveKillhope, Burnhope, and Wellhope Moors. _Fell_ is Old Norse. All theWeardale moorlands are called fells. Chapel Fell is 2,294 feet abovesea-level; A _common_ is a tract of unenclosed pasture or outside landon which the tenantry of the inlands have a common right, or right ofcommon for their sheep._Bank_, _band_, _brae_, and _brow_, are common in place-names, as BrookBank, Owsen Bands, Whitfield Brow, etc. _Batts_, low, flat ground nearwater; Anglo-Saxon _bæth_, a bath, land subject to be soaked with water._Berry_, as Knoutberry Hill, Bleaberry, and Snodberry, are from theAnglo-Saxon _beorg_, _beorh_, a hill. _Cut_, _cove_, as Cove’s Houses;_crooks_, as Milncrook, Seggecrok, Crawcrook, are found. Also _end_, asHill End; and _edge_, as White Edge, Band Edge. _Flat_, _green_, and_ground_, are also found in several place-names, as Barnflat, WillowGreen, and Trodden Ground. In the Boldon Buke we have Pelhou, Quesshow,and Dunhow, from _haw_, Anglo-Saxon _hæge_, a hedge._Haugh_ is a common name in Northumberland for low-lying grounds closeto rivers. It is frequently met with on the Tyne, but it is not socommon on the Wear. Worsaae returns _haugh_ in no other county thanNorthumberland, to which he ascribes ten, the _haugh_, or _how_, beinggiven as the Scandinavian _haugh_, a hill; but the _haugh_ of theBorderland is low-lying and sheltered meadow-land close to the windingrivers. In 1380, at Stanhope, there was a Castle Hogh, known as theCastle Haugh until within fifty years ago. There is a _haugh_ at Softly,and a _haughing-gate_ at Eastgate. There are various _haughs_ in andabout Blanchland, and it might appear that Weardale, where it is veryrare, formed the southern boundary. But there are, however, three_haughs_ in the West Riding._Hooks_, _height_, _hole_, and _howl_. We have Fairy Holes--caves in thelimestone--Foxholes, Brockholes, and Catholes, as names of places; HoleHouse, Clay Holes, and many others. Cuthbert Heights is from St.Cuthbert. _Knot_, _loc_, _lake_, _land_, as the Knotts, the Locks,Cocklake, and the Lands. _Mea_, Welsh _maes_, Erse _magh_--a plan--isvery common in the Durham dales. In Teesdale there is Flushy Mea, SowMea; and, in Weardale, Broad Mea, Mea Sike, Pitty Mea, Rimea, andothers. _Mound_, moss, _nook_, _rake_, _pit_, and _pot_, occur in manynames._Side_, a Saxon word, Icelandic _sida_, the edge, a hillside, entersinto a number of names of places, as Fell Side, Kirk Side, with_siders_, as Cuthbert Siders; and also _sedeing_, a sideling or sloping._Slack_, _spot_, _wick_, _wham_, _clints_, _crag_, _carr_, _scar_, areamongst other words forming place-names.Habitations and enclosures have their special names.When the Angles and Saxons arrived in our island they plantedsettlements in fertile districts. By the margins of some meanderingriver, which had already been named by the earlier Celtic race, theSaxon families located themselves and established homes, many of whichare now large towns. The forest growth was cleared, and, with that loveof home characteristic of the Saxons, a portion of the cleared land wasenclosed, guarded, or protected, with the _tines_ of forest growth--thetines or twigs of the wood; hence _tun_ occurs in 137 Anglo-Saxon namesof places in the 1,200 taken from Kemble’s Charters. This terminationbecame to mean, not the tines or twigs alone, nor yet the hedges ofwhich they were made, but the whole enclosure or estate was the _tun_ or_ton_ of some person; or the _ton_ otherwise distinguished, as Stockton,the stockaded town; Middleton, the middle town; Willington, the town ofthe family of Willing--sons of Will. Other terminations indicate Saxonhomes, as _ham_, _worth_, _stoke_, _stow_, _fold_, _bury_. In the BoldonBuke we find the Danish _toft_; and the universal description of smallholdings in Hatfield’s Survey is a _toft_ and a _croft_. We also find inprimitive days the villagers holding _dales_ of land--land divided intolong, narrow strips or divisions, each villager knowing his own strip.When Weardale was more under cultivation, it was customary for theinhabitants to _take in_ land from the moors; hence we find theplace-name _intake_, locally _intak_. And at a later period still, whenActs of Parliament dealt with the division of moorlands, we got the name_allotment_, abbreviated to _lotment_ and _lot_--the allotted land._Acre_ is mentioned, as in Farnacres, in the Boldon Buke; and in latersurveys are Longacre and Etheredacres. _Barn_, _berry_, _beeld_, _byre_,and _by_, _bower_, _cave_, _castle_, _chesters_, _close_, _croft_,_dale_, and _darg_--as six darg, from Anglo-Saxon _dæg-weorc_, day’swork. _Fold_, _farm_, _faw_, _frith_, _gate_, _garth_, _hot_, _ing_,_ham_, _kirk_, _lodge_, _park_, _meadow_, _pry_, _shield_, _stead_,_ton_, and _wall_, are common in the dales of the county of Durham.Amongst the names referring to buildings we have _cross_, as KillhopeCross and Edmundbyres Cross. Stone crosses to guide the wayfarer wereonce erected at these places. _Brig_ is from bridge, whether built ofstone or wood. _Currock_, a pile of stones erected on the moors or fellsas a landmark. _Peth_ and _lonnon_ and _way_ are also common names. Andall these have their adjectival component, as Lodge Field, Leases Park,Mill Houses, Pry Hill, Old Faw, Shield Ash, Watch Currock, etc.DURHAM CATHEDRALBY THE REV. WILLIAM GREENWELL, M.A., D.C.L., F.R.S., F.S.A.In the year 875 the great Scandinavian invasions were assuming largeproportions, and among other parts of England where the Danes landed andharried the country was the coast of Northumbria. The monks fled fromLindisfarne, which had been selected by Aidan principally because of itsresemblance to Iona. There was probably another reason for the choice:its neighbourhood to the stronghold of Bamborough, the seat of theNorthumbrian Kings. Lindisfarne is very near to it, and naturally wouldbe under the protection of the King who lived there.Bamborough, however, proved no protection against the Danes, who cameoversea, and, landing on the coast, overran not only a great part of theNorth of England, but also a considerable portion of the South ofScotland. The monks, fearing lest they should be deprived of St.Cuthbert’s body and their other treasures, and of their lives as well,fled from Lindisfarne, carrying with them the body of the saint. Manychurches dedicated to St. Cuthbert in these parts probably mark thespots where the monks in their journeying rested for a while.After wandering from 875 to 883, having remained for a short time atCrayke, they settled at Chester-le-Street, which was given to them byGuthred, a Danish King then reigning in Northumbria, and who had becomea Christian.There the body rested, and from it the Bernician See was ruled until theremoval of Bishop Aldhun and the congregation of St. Cuthbert (after ashort sojourn at Ripon) to Durham in 995. The difficulties of anadequate defence probably proved to the monks that Chester-le-Street wasnot a suitable place for their protection. The superior position ofDurham was no doubt the reason why it was selected for the site of thesee. This, then, was the commencement of the church and city of Durham.In 999 Bishop Aldhun, having commenced it three years before, completedthe building of a stone church, to which the body of St. Cuthbert wastransferred from a wooden building (_æcclesiola_, Symeon calls it),where it had been at first placed. Of that church no part remainsvisible to the eye, though there are no doubt thousands of the stonesbelonging to it enclosed within the walls of the present church.The first building remained until after the Norman Conquest, a greatchange having taken place in the meantime. The monks who, with theBishop, had originally constituted the congregation of St. Cuthbert, hadfallen from the rule which was first observed. There was in those days agreat tendency among the regular clergy in the Saxon Church todegenerate into a kind of secular clergy. Symeon says those at Durhamwere neither monks nor regular canons. At Durham, as at Hexham, somemembers of the congregation were married and had families, and there wasspringing up at Durham possibly, as there certainly was at Hexham, anhereditary system, son succeeding father; and had the system gone on,there would have arisen a sacerdotal caste, with all the evils attendingsuch a body. The Norman Conquest happily did away with that, as it didwith other abuses. It is probable that some remains connected with thesemarried members of the congregation were discovered in 1874, when thefoundations of the east end of the old chapter-house, which was soruthlessly destroyed in 1796, were laid bare. The graves of BishopsRanulph Flambard, Galfrid Rufus, and William de St. Barbara were metwith, each covered with a slab bearing his name--probably not quitecontemporary--and in them were found three episcopal rings of gold, setwith sapphires, and in the grave of Flambard, the head, made of iron,plated with silver, and the iron ferrule of a pastoral staff, all ofwhich are now preserved in the cathedral library. Below the level of theBishops’ graves there were found a considerable number of skeletons ofmen, women, and children, with one of which was deposited the iron headof a spear, having the socket plated with gold. There can be littledoubt that these bodies belonged to the married portion of thecongregation and their families, who occupied the monastery at Durhamfrom the time of Aldhun to their being dispossessed by Bishop William ofSt. Carileph.Allusion has already been made to the congregation of St. Cuthbert, butof that body some further account must be given. The religiouscommunity, the congregation of St. Cuthbert, which ultimately settled atDurham, included the Bishop and the monks. The two formed one body,whose interests were identical, and whose property was in common; andthe Bishop lived among the monks, over whom he ruled within thecommunity as he ruled over the diocese without, having no estates ormeans of subsistence separate from the congregation of which he formed apart. This unity between the Bishop and the monks was very similar tothat which prevailed amongst the early religious communities in Irelandand Scotland. The system went on at Durham until the establishment ofthe Benedictine Order there by Bishop William of St. Carileph, shortlyafter the Norman Conquest. He was the second Bishop appointed by WilliamI., Walcher, the first Norman Bishop, having been killed, after a shortreign, by his own people at Gateshead, during a rebellion caused by theoppression of his officials. William of St. Carileph, Abbot of St.Vincent, became Bishop in 1081. Originally a secular priest, heafterwards became a monk in the monastery of St. Calais, and such anestablishment as that he found at Durham must have been most distastefulto him. A Benedictine monk himself, he naturally preferred beingsurrounded by religious of his own Order, and not by those of whosesystem he disapproved. In the time of Bishop Walcher the ancientmonasteries of Jarrow and Wearmouth were to a great extent, thoughprobably not altogether, deserted, and had been so since they were laidwaste by the Danes. When Bishop William determined upon establishingBenedictine monks at Durham, he found these two monasteries alreadyexisting at Jarrow and Wearmouth. Thinking there were not sufficientprovision for the maintenance of more than one monastery, he transferredthe monks from Jarrow and Wearmouth to Durham in 1083, and founded aBenedictine house there. He became a party to the rebellion againstWilliam Rufus in 1088, and was driven an exile for three years intoNormandy. It may well be that during his sojourn there he conceived thedesign of replacing the old church by a new and more magnificent one.Normandy at that time was full of large and noble churches, many latelyerected, and we can readily understand how the thought may have passedacross the mind of Carileph that, if he ever returned to Durham, hewould raise there a more glorious building, and one better adapted tothe wants of the new community than the church he had left behind him.At all events, on his return, he determined to build a new church, andmay we not suppose that gratitude was among the motives which inducedhim to do this? In the meanwhile, during the time of his exile, as welearn from Symeon, the monks had built the refectory as, says he, it nowstands. Symeon was living in the early part of the twelfth century; hetherefore speaks with authority. The crypt under the refectory, whichstill exists, cannot be later than Symeon’s time, and must therefore bepart of the refectory built during Carileph’s exile (1088-1091), and istherefore in either case one of the earliest buildings at Durham inconnection with the monastery.[Illustration:_W LEIGHTON1909_THE CRYPT, DURHAM CATHEDRAL.]This very ancient structure lies on the south side of the cloister, andto the west of a contemporary passage leading from it into the greatenclosure of the monastery, now called the college. The passage itselfhas an arcade of low blind arches on either side, and openings, possiblycoeval with it, lead into the crypt under the refectory at one side,and into a smaller one on the other. The refectory crypt is low, beingonly seven and a half feet high, and commences at the east end with adivision, which has a plain, barrel-shaped vault. From this an archedopening leads into the main area of the crypt. It is divided into threeaisles by two rows of short, massive square pillars, four in each row,making five bays in the length. The pillars support a plain groinedvault without ribs or transverse arches. This space is again succeededtowards the west by three divisions, the westernmost one being not solong as the others, all the three having, like the first and easternmostone, plain barrel vaults. Up to this point the whole crypt is of thesame early date, but beyond, to the west of what appears to be anoriginal wall, are some other structures, the cellar and pantry, oflater times. The older crypt has been lighted on the south side by atleast seven, or possibly more, small windows, all round-headed exceptone, which is circular.To the east of the passage there is, as has already been stated, asmaller crypt, which in general corresponds with the architecturalcharacter of that under the refectory. It is now beneath theentrance-hall of the deanery, once part of the Prior’s hall, and hasapparently been curtailed of some of its original length.Symeon, a monk of Durham, already mentioned, lived when a great part ofthe work at the church was going on, and therefore his testimony is veryimportant. He wrote a history of the church of Durham, and his historywas continued after him by an anonymous writer. We next have a furthercontinuation by Geoffrey de Coldingham, Robert de Graystanes, andWilliam de Chambre, together with a number of indulgences from variousBishops, given towards obtaining means for making additions to andalterations in the building, and a few, but late, fabric rolls. Besidesthese there is a most important document, \"A Description or BriefDeclaration of all the Ancient Monuments, Rites, and Customs belongingor being within the Monastical Church of Durham before the Suppression,\"apparently written towards the end of the sixteenth century by someonewho had been an inmate of the monastery. These form the series ofhistorical evidences which now exist with regard to the dates of thevarious parts of the church.In 1093, on August 11, the foundation-stones of the new church werelaid, the foundations themselves having been dug on the preceding July29. Aldhun’s church, as Symeon tells us, had been previously destroyed.There were then present Bishop William of St. Carileph; Turgot, Prior ofthe monastery, afterwards Bishop at St. Andrews; and, as other writerssay, Malcolm, King of Scotland. The continuator of Symeon says that, onthe accession of Flambard, he found the church finished as far as thenave. This statement does not, of course, imply that the whole of thiswas the work of Carileph, for the monks after his death had carried onthe building of the church; but it appears on the whole probable that,with the exception of the west side of the transepts and the vaulting ofthe choir, all the church up to the point mentioned had been builtbefore the death of Carileph.It may be well to give here a general description of the Norman work,taking the nave first, as being the most important feature in the wholegreat scheme. The nave consists of three double compartments, a singlebay westward of these, and the western bay flanked by the towers. Theprincipal piers consist of triple shafts, placed on each face of acentral mass, square in plan; the shafts rest on massive bases ofcruciform plan, having a flat projecting band about the middle and anarrow plinth at the bottom. A similar band and plinth are carriedbeneath the wall-arcades of the nave and transepts and entirely roundthe church on the outside. In the choir, however, except on the piers ofthe tower arch, the bases are without a band, but have a plinth ofgreater height, the responds on the aisle walls being similar. Thetriple shafts next the nave or choir rise almost to the top of thetriforium, and support the great transverse arches of the vault. Theshafts next the aisles receive the diagonal and transverse ribs of theaisle vault, and the shafts on the two remaining faces receive thearches of the great arcade. The intermediate piers, in the centre ofeach double compartment, are circular in plan, and stand on squarebases. The western pair of piers, at the corners of the towers, areclustered like the other main piers, but have two additional shafts(like the crossing piers), but these shafts on the side next the navereceive the diagonal ribs of the vault, whereas the additional shafts onthe crossing piers support the outer order of the tower arches.The triforium is of eight bays, having a containing arch with twosub-arches, the tympanum being solid. The clerestory has in each of itseight bays a lofty and wide arch with a smaller and lower one on eachside, the central arch having a window fronting it. It has a wallpassage which connects it with the clerestories on the west side of thetransepts. The inner arcade in the eastern bays appears to be aninsertion, possibly made when the vault was put on the nave. The idea ofvaulting the nave was apparently abandoned, when the triforium stage wasreached, and it is probable that the arrangement of the nave clerestorywas at first not unlike that of the south transept. The resumption ofthe vaulting idea thus necessitated an alteration in the design of theclerestory.The nave is covered a double quadripartite vault over each doublecompartment, without transverse ribs over the minor piers. The greattransverse arches, which spring from the major piers, are pointed. Thediagonal ribs, which rise from corbels inserted in the spandrils of thetriforium arches, are semicircular. They are all decorated with zigzag.The choir consists of two double compartments, and in its plan as awhole agrees with that of the nave. There are, however, some differencesin the details. The piers of the great arcades, although similar inmotive to those of the nave, are much longer from east to west, and are,in fact, more like sections of wall than piers. The clerestory is quiteunlike that of the nave, having a plain round-headed arch in each bay,with a corresponding window, and is destitute of a wall passage. Thetriforiums on both sides of the choir and on the east side of thetransepts are all very similar. They are lighted by windows, consistingof two small round-headed openings, about twenty inches apart, under acontaining arch. The buttressing arches, which are opposite the piers,are semicircular in form, and are contemporaneous with the arcades. Eachtransept has two double bays, with an aisle on the east side. The vaulton the north transept has one transverse arch, which is semicircular,the double bay to the north having a single quadripartite vault withsegmental diagonal ribs. All the ribs are moulded with a roll betweentwo hollows. The south transept has a similarly formed vault, but theribs are enriched with zigzag. The triforium and other upper parts ofthe church are reached by staircases contained in two square internalprojections which are in the north-west and south-west angles of thetransept. The end walls of the transepts were probably lighted by threetiers of windows; the lowest--which still remains--though blocked up, inthe south transept, is a single round-headed window. It is difficult tosay what was the arrangement above, but probably there were threewindows on the triforium level and one on that of the clerestory.Passages crossed the ends at these levels, but none now remain in theiroriginal state.The vaults of the aisles of the choir, transepts, and nave, arequadripartite and are the same throughout, except that the diagonal ribsof the nave aisles beyond the two eastern bays have zigzag upon them.The transverse ribs, which rise alike from both piers and columns, arecomposed of a flat soffit, with a roll and shallow on each edge, thediagonal ribs having a large roll between two hollows. The firstcompartment of the nave arcade, which comprises two bays and the eastbay of the triforium arcade, correspond in their mouldings and otherfeatures with those of the choir, whereas in the remainder of the nave,although the elevation in its general design and principal features isthe same, the mouldings in some essential particulars, especially in theuse of the zigzag and the course of small sunk squares forming a quasihood-moulding round the arches of the great arcade, differ from those ofthe choir. There is a difference also in the way in which the diagonalribs of the main vault was carried. In the choir the diagonal ribs ofthe original Norman vault are supported on shafts, which still remainand rise from the level of the triforium floor; on the east side of thetransept they are supported by similar shafts; in the nave they aresupported on brackets formed of two grotesque heads, inserted in thespandrils between the containing arches of the triforium. The easterncompartment of the nave arcade, with the triforium arch above it, which,before the nave was completed, acted as an abutment to the tower archeson the west side, as the similar and corresponding arches of thetransepts did on the north and south, must necessarily have been builtat the same time as the tower arches themselves, and, therefore,naturally corresponds with them in the details.The spiral grooving on the piers, a rare feature in Norman work, is seenin the choir and transepts, but not in the nave, where lozenge andzigzag patterns and flutings are used instead. The spirals are contraryto the ordinary direction of those on a screw. The eastern part ofCarileph’s church no longer exists, having been replaced by a verybeautiful eastern transept. Until some important excavations were madein 1895, it was generally believed that the choir ended in an apsidaltermination, with an extension of the aisles forming an ambulatoryround it. The foundations of the east end of the aisles, as well as ofthe choir, together with a small portion of the choir wall itself, werethen discovered. From what remained it was shown that Carileph’s choirterminated in three apses, the central one, which extended 27 feetbeyond the others, being semicircular on the outside as well as within,while those at the end of the aisles had been semicircular only on theinside, being finished square externally.To Galfrid Rufus may be attributed the present great north and southdoorways of the nave, themselves, however, replacing earlier ones. Thesculpturing upon these doorways, and that upon the corbels which oncesupported the ribs at the east end of the chapter-house, have apparentlybeen done by the same hand, and there is otherwise much in commonbetween the decoration of these doorways and that of the chapter-houseitself.Skilfully wrought and probably contemporary ironwork covers the southdoor, still remaining in a very perfect state.On the north door there are sufficient indications to show what was thepattern of the ironwork once there, and, indeed, with care and under afavourable light, the very elaborate design may be made out. Thegrotesque but effective sanctuary knocker of bronze, of the same date asthe door itself, if it does not invite the unfortunate offender to seekfor that protection now, happily, under more humane conditions, notneeded for his safety, will recall to memory how the Church in a ruderage held out her saving hand, and interposed between the shedder ofblood, sometimes guiltless, and the avenger.The death of Bishop Carileph took place in 1096, and an interval ofthree years elapsed before the election of Bishop Flambard, in 1099, whois described as great by some, and infamous by other, writers.Ralph Flambard was William Rufus’s Chancellor, and whether he wasinfamous or not, he was, anyhow, a remarkable man. We are told by thecontinuator of Symeon, that he carried on the work of the nave up to theroof--that is, that he completed the nave as far as the vault, includingthe side aisles and their vaults, and probably at the same time buildingthat portion of the western towers which attains an equal elevation withthe walls of the nave.[Illustration: THE SANCTUARY KNOCKER, DURHAM CATHEDRAL.]Flambard probably began to build soon after he became Bishop, and thoughthat part of the church which is due to him might not have been finisheduntil near the time of his death, no material alteration seems to havebeen made in the plan. With regard to the upper part of the westerntowers, and the time when they were built, we are entirely left to theevidence of the architecture itself, for nothing has been recorded whichhas reference to their erection. The upper stages belong to a time whenthe style called the Early English was being developed, and they mayhave been constructed during the episcopate of Richard de Marisco(1217-26), or even of Philip de Pictavia (1197-1208). Although thetowers have suffered much from weathering, and more from the paringprocess, which, however, to some extent, has been remedied by the latereparation, they are well designed and very effective additions to thechurch as originally planned. In combination with the end of the naveand the bold mouldings of Pudsey’s Galilee, they form a terminationwhich will not suffer even when compared with some of our finest westfronts. The upper part of both is enriched by four arcades, two open andtwo blank, of alternately round-headed and pointed arches. The towerswere, until the time of the Commonwealth, surmounted by spires of woodcovered with lead. At present they are finished by a parapet withturrets, placed there at the beginning of the present century, which,though faulty in detail, are, nevertheless, by no means unworthy of thetowers they crown, and add materially to the picturesque outline of thecathedral when viewed from a distance.Bishop Cosin, in his articles of inquiry at his first visitation in1662, asks: \"What is become of the wood and lead of the two greatbroaches that stood upon the square towers at the west end of thechurch?\" (_Miscellanea_, Surtees Society, vol. xxxvii., p. 257). Thisinquiry was repeated in Cosin’s second visitation, July 17, 1665, andthe reply made in the presentment of the minor canons, etc., was asfollows: \"And as for the lead and timber of the two great broaches atthe west end of the church, Mr. Gilbert Marshall can give the bestaccount how they were employed\" (Hunter MSS., vol. xi., No. 94). To[Illustration: THE WESTERN TOWERS OF DURHAM CATHEDRAL, FROM THE WINDOWOF THE MONKS’ LIBRARY._From a Drawing by R. W. Billings._]this reply James Green, minor canon and sacrist, adds: \"Mr. GilbertMarshall, Mr. Gilpin, and Mr. Anthony Smith, can best tell what becameof it\" (Hunter MSS., vol. xi., No. 98). Bishop Cosin would remember themas being on the towers when he was Prebendary before the time of theCommonwealth. That they were never rebuilt is shown by Buck’s view,published in 1732, where the towers are without spires.The most important, as it is not the least striking and beautiful,object in the choir is the large and lofty throne, built by BishopThomas de Hatfield (1345-81) during his lifetime, for his tomb beneathand the throne above. It is a structure worthy of the Palatine See ofDurham and of the mighty Prince-Bishop who erected it. The alabasterfigure of the Bishop still remains, comparatively perfect, clothed inrichly decorated pontifical vestments, lying on an altar-tomb under acanopy whose groining is finely ornamented with bosses of boldlysculptured foliage. Upon the wall at each end of the arch, and oppositeto the head and feet of the Bishop, are two angels painted in fresco.Those at the feet hold a blank shield, but at the other end the paintingis too much damaged to allow the object they hold to be made out. Thewhole throne has once been richly gilded and coloured, and contains manyshields with the Bishop’s and other arms upon them. In the constructionof the upper portion of the throne it is not well fitted into the spaceit occupies between the pillars, and some of its parts do not quitecorrespond with each other. The impression given by these incongruitiesis that Hatfield used some pieces of stonework already carved before heplanned the throne, and that it possibly was, like the Galilee, notintended from the first to occupy the position in which it wasultimately placed.Another beautiful piece of work of about the same period as the throneis the screen behind the high-altar, commenced to be built in 1372 andfinished before 1380, when the altar was dedicated. It is commonlycalled the Neville Screen, on account of a great part of the expense oferecting it having been defrayed by John, Lord Neville, of Raby, thoughPrior Fossor (1341-74), Prior Berrington (1374-91), and others, boresome part of the cost. It was brought from London to Newcastle by sea,and has always been spoken of as made of Caen stone, \"French peere\" asit is called in the rites of Durham, being really Dorsetshire clunch.St. Cuthbert is said to have had a more than usual monastic dislike towomen--though some of his most intimate friends were women--andtherefore to have built the Lady Chapel at the east end of the choir,the ordinary position, which was close to his shrine, would have beenmost distasteful to him. No woman, indeed, was allowed to approachfarther eastward in the church than as far as a line of dark-colouredFrosterley marble, forming a cross with two short limbs at the centre,which stretches across the nave between the piers, just west of thenorth and south doors. The Chapel of the Blessed Virgin,[9] commonlycalled the Galilee, was therefore placed where we now see it. It risesalmost directly from the edge of the river-bank, and is built againstthe west front of the church. It is of an oblong form, of five aislesdivided by four arcades, each of four bays, the aisles being all of thesame width. The middle aisle is higher than those adjoining, and theseagain are higher than the extreme north and south ones. The arches,richly decorated with zigzag, are supported upon columns, originallycomposed of two slender shafts of Purbeck marble, but now of fourshafts, alternately of marble and sandstone, the latter, added byCardinal Langley when he repaired the Galilee in which he placed histomb in front of the altar, having capitals of plain volutes, which arevery characteristic of the Transitional period. The chapel was enteredfrom without through a doorway on the north side, which has beenrestored, the old one, however, having been exactly copied to theminutest parts. The doorway is deeply recessed, the wall being increasedin thickness on both sides in the manner usual at that time, and is afine example of the style in use when it was erected. Access to thechurch from the Galilee was also obtained through the great west door,which was probably not blocked up until Bishop Langley placed the altarof the Blessed Virgin there, and made two doors, one at the north andthe other at the south end of the west wall. The chapel was at firstlighted by eight round-headed windows, placed high in the wall above thearches of the outer arcade on the north and south sides, and no doubthad other windows at the west end. The three windows in the north walland the four in the south, originally inserted about the close of thethirteenth century, when the walls were raised in height, have all beenrenewed, so far as the mullions and tracery are concerned. It isprobable that at the same time five similar windows were placed in thewest wall, of which only two are now left, the others having given placeto three fifteenth-century windows. At the time when these importantalterations were made, the original windows in the wall above the archeswere probably blocked up. Their outline, however, is still to be tracedquite distinctly.It must not be overlooked that the shrine containing the bones of theVenerable Bede were ultimately placed in the Galilee in 1370, in frontof his altar. The bones are now placed in a plain tomb, having upon itthe well-known inscription, which, however, was only engraved on thecovering slab in 1830:    HAC SUNT IN FOSSA BEDÆ VENERABILIS OSSA.There are some beautiful and well-preserved fresco paintings on the eastwall at its north end. They are contemporary with the building, andcomprise a King and Bishop, probably St. Oswald and St. Cuthbert, andsome tasteful decoration of conventional leaf forms, verycharacteristic of the art of the period. The lower part of the back ofthe recess, on the sides of which the figures occur, is filled with arepresentation of hangings, the middle of which is now defaced, butwhere, before the Dissolution, was a picture of our Lady with the deadChrist. It is not impossible that the principal altar of the BlessedVirgin originally stood there, and was transferred by Cardinal Langleyto the position it afterwards occupied when he probably built up thegreat western doorway of the church. The site in question was, up to thetime of the Reformation, devoted to the altar of Our Lady of Pity, orPiety, which may have been removed thither by Langley from the recess tothe north of it, which is surmounted by an arch with the dentel mouldingof a date apparently not later than the commencement of the thirteenthcentury--a removal necessitated by his making there one of the two newdoorways into the Galilee. These paintings are not only of greatinterest in themselves, but they possess a further one of being the onlyspecimens of fresco decoration in the cathedral which are now anythingmore than mere fragments. The arches and capitals in the Galilee havealso been enriched by colour, among the designs being a zigzag andspiral pattern. It does not appear that this kind of decoration had everbeen used to any great extent throughout the church, for very fewremains of it were discovered when the modern whitewash was latelyremoved.In the aisle, however, of the north transept, where the altars of St.Benedict and St. Gregory and that of St. Nicholas and St. Giles oncestood, there are some portions of the pictures which adorned the wallbehind them, including, in connection with St. Gregory’s altar, theupper part of a figure vested with the pallium. There are also somescanty remnants of colour left behind the altars of Our Lady of Houghalland Our Lady of Bolton in the aisle of the south transept. The site ofthe Neville Chantry in the south aisle of the nave still containssufficient remains of the delicate and tasteful pattern to enable oneto judge what the design has been, and slight traces of colour are to befound upon the arches of the arcade behind the altars in the Chapel ofthe Nine Altars. It is probable, indeed, that the walls behind all thealtars in the church have been more or less decorated with painting,though certainly it had not been used generally on the church itself.The point of junction between the Norman choir and thethirteenth-century work which connects it with the eastern transept maybe placed at the fourth pier from the eastern tower arch on each side.The arch of the triforium next these piers comes close up to them,whereas in the corresponding piers to the west there is a space betweenthe arch and the pier. The same feature is to be seen in the triforiumarch, which is next to the piers of the tower arch, which have fiveshafts, the others having only three. It is very probable that the piersat the entrance of the apse supported a larger transverse arch than theothers, corresponding in this to the great tower arch, and that thesupporting piers had, like those at the entrance of the choir, fiveshafts. These piers, the body of which forms a part of Carileph’s Normanwork, untouched where they face into the aisles, have been encased onthe choir face with very rich and tasteful decoration of about themiddle of the thirteenth century. Above, upon each side of the choir, isa figure of an angel under a canopy, that on the south side holding acrown in the left hand, the other having lost the uplifted hand and whatit once held. They are the only two left out of a numerous host ofstatues once decorating the church, and their beauty makes thedestruction which has befallen the others the more to be regretted.After the Nine Altars was finished and the connecting part between itand the choir completed, a new vault was put on to the choir, and thewhole of the original Norman vault was taken down. The reason for thiswas almost certainly an artistic one: the sumptuously decorated vault ofthe Nine Altars being of a pointed form, while the original plain vaultof the choir was semicircular, it would have been very difficult, if notimpossible, when the great transverse arch was taken down, to bringthese two forms into harmonious combination. It was replaced by onewhich to a great extent in its mouldings and decoration corresponds withthat of the Nine Altars. This vault is in five compartments, and hasfour richly moulded transverse arches in addition to the eastern arch ofthe crossing. These arches are supported alternately on the mainvaulting-shafts, which rise from the floor, and on triple shafts, whichrise from the level of the triforium floor, and originally received thediagonal ribs of the Norman vault. The diagonal ribs spring from theouter shafts of the three semi-shafts and from the corresponding outershafts next to the main vaulting-shafts. The vault is quadripartite, butin the eastern bay is an additional rib on each side--a quasi ridge-rib,which runs north and south from the spandrils between the clerestoryarches, and unites at the intersection of the diagonal ribs. Theadditional rib on the north side springs from a draped male seatedfigure, on each side of which is a lacertine creature with its back tothe figure, and its head turned so that the mouth touches the hair,while the tail curves towards the feet; that on the south side springsfrom an angel. The wall ribs spring from shafts of Frosterley marble,resting on inserted corbels or on the capitals of the Normanvaulting-shafts. In the eastern angle of the eastern bay the wall rib oneach side springs from the head of a small canopy, which contains asculptured figure; that on the north side a demibishop blessing; that onthe south the upper half of a male figure.Whatever difficulty, however, there may have been in collecting thenecessary funds for the erection of this noble addition to the church ofBishop William of St. Carileph, first projected by Bishop Poore, noexpense or pains has been spared in its being carried out to perfection,and the vault of the Nine Altars and choir, the last part of this greatwork, with its enrichment of dog-tooth ornament of various and gracefulforms, and bosses of foliage and figure subjects, fitly completes thebuilding in a style no less beautiful and effective than the walls whichsupport it. It may be asserted without fear of contradiction that nomore effective or majestic vault crowns any church in our country.The cloister occupies a considerable space of ground left open at thecentre, where the lavatory was placed, and was enclosed on the northside by the church, and on the other sides by those various structureswhich had relation to the household economy of the monastery and to itsdomestic and political life. Around it, in the dormitory and refectory,the monks slept, lived, and ate. They studied in the library and in thesmall wooden chambers--carells, as they were called--one of which wasplaced in front of each compartment of the windows of the north alley,which, like the east one, was glazed, the latter containing in itswindows the history of St. Cuthbert. In the west alley the novices hadtheir school, where they were taught by the master of the novices, \"oneof the oldest monks that was learned,\" who had opposite to them \"apretty seat of wainscot, adjoining to the south side of the treasurydoor.\"In the treasury, situated at the north end of the crypt under thedormitory, and which is still divided by its ancient iron grating, werekept the title-deeds and other muniments of the church, in themselves nosmall treasure. At the other end of the same crypt was the common house,the only place where there was a fire for ordinary use, and which wasfrequented by the monks as their room for converse and recreation, andwhich had in connection with it a garden and a bowling alley.In the chapter-house on the east side the monks met the Prior betweenfive and six o’clock \"every night there to remain in prayer anddevotion\" during that time. Here also at other times they assembled inchapter to regulate all matters connected with the life within thebody, and to order the many transactions which as a great corporationthe convent necessarily had with the world without. Close by, on the oneside of the chapter-house, out of which it opened, was the prison, wherefor minor offences a monk was confined; and on the other side was thepassage through which his body was conveyed to his last home in thecemetery beyond.Opening out of the dormitory to the east, at its south end, where amodern doorway has replaced the earlier one, is a room which was calledby the monks \"the loft,\" and which forms, in connection with therefectory, the south side of the cloister. It was the place where themonks, with the Subprior presiding, ordinarily dined, having beneath itwhat was once the cellar of the convent. Beyond this, to the east, wasthe refectory, or frater-house, standing above the early crypt which hasalready been described, where the Prior and monks dined together onMarch 20--St. Cuthbert’s Day. Whatever it was before then, thoughpossibly the original building still remained, in part at least,unaltered, it was entirely reconstructed by Dean Sudbury (1662-84), whomade it into the library, transferring the books from the old libraryadjoining to the chapter-house, and filling it with the handsome andcommodious oak cases which now furnish it. Near to it, on thesouth-west, is the kitchen of the monastery, now attached to thedeanery, an octagonal building which well deserves examination.Returning to the cloister, there may still be seen at the centre of thegarth what is left above ground of the lavatory. It was originally anoctagonal structure, the upper part being occupied as a dovecote. Thebasin was begun in 1432, and completed the next year. The marblestones of the basin, which still exists, were brought fromEggleston-on-the-Tees, of the Abbot of which monastery they were bought.The basin is not _in situ_, but has at some time been removed from itsoriginal situation, \"over against the frater-house door,\" where thefoundations of a circular, or octagonal, building were discovered in1903, and with them those of an earlier building, square in form, withthe substructure of an earlier basin.Before concluding the description of the church, it is necessary that afew words should be said about the exterior. It has charms of its ownwhich, in spite of the disasters it has undergone in the shape of paringdown and refacing, still makes it one of our noblest churches.It must be admitted that, on account of the removal of some inches fromthe surface of the stone,[10] and the consequent curtailment ofmouldings in their projections and hollows, there is a want of light andshade which much detracts from its effect when seen near at hand.Indeed, the first impression made is perhaps one of disappointment. Theeast end is especially flat and bald, and with its ill-designed modernpinnacles forms but a poor clothing to the wondrous beauty which is tobe seen within the Nine Altars. But with all these drawbacks, whenviewed as a whole, and when distance has lent its compensating power,the cathedral, its lofty central tower rising in harmonious combinationwith the two western ones, stands sublime in its grand outline, andfitly crowns the hill of Durham.FINCHALE PRIORYBY J. TAVENOR-PERRYAfter the Romans had completed the subjection of the Brigantes theyconstructed a great military road through the centre of their countryfrom Eburicum, which became the capital of the province, to the Tweedand the country beyond. This road intersected the county of Durham fromnorth to south, and much of its course can still be traced from itspoint of entry at Pierce Bridge, through Vinovium or Binchester inAuckland, Epiacum or Lanchester, and Vindomora or Ebchester where itpasses over the Derwent into Northumberland. From Binchester a branchroad led by way of Chester-le-Street to the Pons Ælii or Newcastle,which was continued by another branch to Jarrow and South Shieldspassing along the south bank of the Tyne. This great military road andthe branch to Newcastle were cut through the dense forest which thencovered the whole of Durham and which continued through Saxon times toform an almost impassable boundary, save by these roads, between theclosely associated provinces of Deira and Bernicia. The considerableremains of the Roman towns still standing after the conquest ofNorthumbria by the Angles were no doubt occupied by them as settlements;and we find it stated in the life of St. Cuthbert that when he wascrossing the wild country of Durham and was like to be starved he foundsuccour from someone residing in the buildings still remaining atChester-le-Street. Along the sides of the roads, between the towns,would be the ruins, not then entirely destroyed, of villas and otherbuildings which may have formed places for rest or refuge to those wholike the saint traversed these dangerous forest paths, from which mayhave been derived the names of localities still in use although theruins after which they were called have long since been forgotten. Themonks who were conveying the body of St. Cuthbert to its finalresting-place were directed to take it to Dunholm, and an accidentrevealed to them the obscure place which then bore that name; and whenSt. Godric was directed to repair to Finchale and there build himself ahermitage, he only discovered there was a place so called by a chanceconversation he had with a monk at Durham.The name of Finchale must have been well known in the ninth century ifwe accept the common and reasonable belief that it was a place ofmeeting of two or three important councils concerned with the affairs ofNorthumbria. Its position in reference to the great road passing to theSouth, its accessibility to the neighbouring town of Chester-le-Streetonly three or four miles distant, and its comparative seclusion in thegreat surrounding forest made it particularly suitable for suchmeetings, which were held, as Bishop Stubbs says in his _ConstitutionalHistory_, generally on the confines of states whence those assembledmight easily retire at nightfall to safer places. The councils held inNorthumbria during the latter part of the eighth century met at a timewhen the country was not only disturbed by internal troubles, butalready threatened by the Danish pirates along the coast; and the forestdepths of Durham were safer for such meetings than the more open landsof Northumberland or Yorkshire. The affix of \"hale,\" the Saxon \"hal,\"signifies the existence of a hall or some building, perhaps the remainsof a Roman villa, which would have served as a temporary shelter for themembers of a council, of which all traces have long since disappeared;but, taking all the circumstances together, we may fairly assume thatFinchale was the place in which these Northumbrian councils met, and thename still lingered in the locality when St. Godric established himselfwithin its glades on the banks of the rushing Wear.This Godric, whose name is indissolubly associated with Finchale Priory,although he was in no sense the founder of it, was as selfish and dirtyan old anchorite as ever attained the brevet rank of sainthood. Bornabout 1065, the first thirty years of his life were spent as a pedlarand sailor, during which he travelled far and wide, and met with manyadventures; and the remainder he spent in pilgrimages or a hermit-lifeof penance and prayer. The _Dictionary of National Biography_ gives avery complete history of him, compiled from all available sources, themost important being the MS. life by his contemporary Nicholas ofDurham. While he was leading the roving life of a pedlar he was nearlydrowned in trying to catch a porpoise, and afterwards made a pilgrimageto Rome, presumably in thankfulness for his rescue. But the time wasunfortunate, for it appears to have been about 1086, when Gregory VII.,Hildebrand, had just died in exile, when the Anti-Pope Clement III. wasin possession of the Vatican, while the newly elected Pope Victor III.was afraid to enter Rome, which then lay sunk in the most frightfulanarchy. The spectacle he beheld could scarcely then have induced him toaccept a religious vocation; and we find that for sixteen yearsafterwards he led a seafaring life, trading between England, Scotland,Flanders and Denmark, presently going so far afield as the Holy Land,where the Chronicler’s description of him as \"Gudericus pirata de regnoAngliae\" sufficiently indicates the character of his occupation.Returning thence, he paid a visit to the shrine of St. James ofCompostella; and when he reached home he accepted a menial position inthe house of a countryman, which suggests that he had not made muchmoney by his ventures. But with a restless spirit on him he went twomore pilgrimages to Rome, and the second time he took his mother withhim carrying her, it is said, on his shoulders where the way wasdifficult. It was on this journey that he was accompanied by a lady ofwondrous beauty, whom he met on his way in London, who left him thereagain on his return, and who nightly washed his feet; a story whichperhaps grew out of the custom of noble ladies, and which became morecommon later on, of washing the feet of pilgrims in penance for somespecial sin, in the manner described by Charles Reade in _The Cloisterand the Hearth_. On his return, somewhere about 1104, he settled for atime at Carlisle, and then went to share his cell with a hermit namedAelrice, by Wolsingham, and perhaps learn the lessons which were toguide him in his future life. After a stay here of only seventeen monthsthe hermit died, and directed, he believed, by St. Cuthbert, Godric wentagain on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, after which he was instructed toreturn and take up his residence at Finchale. Not knowing the localityby name he returned to Durham where he resided for some time until achance conversation disclosed the whereabouts of the place.When he at length retired to Finchale he seems to have found there theremains of some ancient building, perhaps of a Roman villa, which mayhave given its name to the place, and which may not only have formed asufficient residence for the hermit but for the other members of hisfamily who came to reside with him. The site of this dwelling was alittle nearer to Durham than is the present Priory, and the lands aroundwere a hunting-ground (the villa may have been a hunting-lodge)belonging to Bishop Ralph Flambard who gave Godric permission to settlehere, so that possession must have been taken before 1128, the date ofthe Bishop’s death. Adjoining to this residence he seems to have builta wooden chapel which was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and abouttwenty years after he built another of stone which was consecrated byBishop William de St. Barbara, dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre and St.John Baptist, and regularly served by a priest from Durham. As well asthe many self-imposed mortifications he endured, he was much troubled bythe serpents with which the place abounded, but which, at his command,departed; but if we may believe the equally veracious story of \"theloathly worm of Lambton,\" a witch as well as a saint had a hand in thatachievement.Godric, who was bedridden with rheumatism, the result of his senileexcesses, for eight years before his death, died in 1170, during theepiscopacy of Bishop Hugh de Puiset, or Pudsey, who appears to havepersonally interested himself in the Finchale oratory; and under hisdirections two monks from the Durham convent, named Henry and Reginald,took up their residence in the place. In 1180 Pudsey confirmed thepriory of Durham in their possession of Finchale and added lands andother benefactions to those already granted by Flambard; and thus nodoubt the attention of his son Henry was drawn to the place.Henry de Pudsey, who may be regarded as the founder of Finchale, wasBishop Pudsey’s eldest illegitimate son, and must have been born somelong time before his father succeeded to the see as the Bishop had otherchildren younger than Henry. His mother was Adelaide de Percy from whomhe appears to have inherited a good deal of land in Craven, as well asthe manors of Wingate and Haswell, with which he afterwards endowedFinchale. At some period not long before the death of Godric he seems tohave been engaged in founding a small establishment for Austen Canons ata place called Bakstanford not far from Neville’s Cross to which themonks of Durham seem to have objected as an intrusion of a foreign orderwithin their immediate sphere of influence. Whether it was inconsequence of their protests or at the wish of his father is uncertain,but he suspended his operations and transferred his endowments toFinchale; and there he erected new monastic buildings for theaccommodation of a colony of Benedictines from Durham who, under Thomasthe Sacrist as Prior, took possession of the convent in 1196, a yearafter the death of Bishop Pudsey. It was apparently the intention alsoof Henry to rebuild Godric’s church in a more suitable manner, but in1198 he became involved in some political troubles and went crusading in1201 from which he did not return until 1212; and he left the rebuildingof the church to be carried out by the community.[Illustration: PISCINA IN CHOIR.]The building of a new church seems to have been taken in hand in 1242, ayear memorable in the annals of Durham Cathedral as the one which sawthe beginning of the great eastern transept of the \"Nine Altars,\" underthe auspices of Prior Thomas of Melsamby, of whom Canon Greenwell says:\"He was one of the greatest men who have sat in the prior’s chair atDurham.\" The subservient position which Finchale held to the Durhamconvent necessitated the assent of its Prior to so important anundertaking; and it is not improbable that he may have pointed out thenecessity of the work and that his architect, Richard de Farnham, wasresponsible for the design. Although of but modest dimensions for apriory church, and but little longer and wider than the chapel which theBrus family had recently built near by at Hartlepool, it was still ontoo ambitious a scale for the limited resources of the convent; and thework dragged on for a number of years, and was never completed in itsentirety. Its chief internal dimensions were--total length of nave andchoir 194 feet and of the transepts 99 feet; the widths of the nave andchoir were 23 feet and of the transepts 21 feet, while the width acrossthe unbuilt aisles would have been 52 feet. But the aisles would seemnever to have been finished, and though Mackensie Walcot patheticallysays that \"it was the hand of the monk which pulled down the chapel ofthe transept and the aisles of the choir and nave\" it seems more thanlikely that they were never begun, and that the idea was abandoned forlack of funds soon after the nave and choir arcades had been completed.It is probable that the choir only was roofed in in a temporary manner,and that the nave and perhaps the transepts as well were not encloseduntil the works were seriously resumed in the next century. The warswith Scotland caused much trouble within the county of Durham, anddoubtless affected the revenues of the priory, although there is nothingto show that the monks were disturbed in any way by the invaders; buttwice the Scotch armies appeared upon the Wear, first under the Douglasjust before the treaty of Northampton made in 1328, and again in 1346when they were defeated at the Battle of Neville’s Cross within sight ofthe cathedral.All works were suspended at Durham as well as at Finchale for the samereasons, but with the return of peace and under the energetic sway ofPrior John Fossor they were resumed; and no doubt under his direct[Illustration: CHOIR.]influence and perhaps with his assistance the completion of the churchat Finchale was undertaken. The account rolls of the priory from 1348begin to mention large quantities of material bought for the works andmoney expended upon labour until 1372 when we may consider the fabric ofthe church was finished. Instead of building the aisles as originallyintended, they filled up the moulded arches of the arcades with wallingin which they inserted traceried windows; and they seemed to have roofedin the buildings at a level but little above the top of the archeswithout any clerestory but sufficiently high to clear the great archesof the crossing. Whether the crossing was vaulted is not quite certain,but some stones found among the ruins seem to indicate remains of groinribs, and it was raised as a low tower, and covered in all probabilitywith a squat, leaded spire such as those which once stood on the westerntowers of the cathedral. The windows which had their heads filled inwith reticulated tracery were, with those of Easington Church and thoseinserted in the cathedral by Prior Fossor, among the most importantDecorated work in the county. The east end of the choir had originallythree lancet windows, but either at this time or later a large traceriedwindow was inserted in their place, the cost of reglazing which appearsin the accounts for 1488. A reredos to the high-altar was erected about1376 during the period when the great Neville screen was in course ofconstruction in the cathedral. The exact position it occupied in thechoir is not now evident, as the position of the original double piscina(see p. 135) and the sedilia left but little room for such an erection,and it seems to have involved some alteration in the arrangements of theeast end. It is clear from existing remains that it was originallyintended to build a chapel on the east side of the north transept andpossibly a corresponding one to the south transept, the former with analtar dedicated to St. Godric and the latter to the Blessed Virgin, butthese chapels were abandoned at the completion; the whole south transeptbecame the Lady Chapel, and it has been suggested that the shrine of St.Godric was removed to the extreme east end of the choir, from which itwas cut off by the new reredos, in which case another piscina which hasdisappeared must have been made for the service of the high-altar. Theancient sedilia of which there were three were cut into and reduced totwo when the large traceried window was inserted in the south wall ofthe choir, and our illustration (see p. 137) shows not only thisalteration but what is supposed to have been the base of the reredos.[Illustration: THE CHURCH FROM THE NORTH-WEST.][Illustration: PLAN OF THE RUINS OF FINCHALE PRIORY.]The arches, which had been left open on the eastern face of thetransepts, were filled in in the same manner as the nave arcades butwith two-light windows in the walling except in the case of the southtransept where there is a five-light window, with the heads uncusped,beneath which was the altar of the Blessed Virgin. In 1469 sixtyshillings was paid for glazing this window. The west walls of thetransepts contain the only original windows left complete, the southtransept having a short lancet which looked over the cloister roof, andthe north transept has two narrow and lofty lancets. The lancets at thenorth end of the transept were doubtless removed for a traceried windowas in the choir; but the triplets of the west front were leftundisturbed, and their remains and the beautifully simple west front,together with the lancets of the transepts, are shown in ourillustration (see p. 139).[Illustration: FRONT OF THE CHAPTER HOUSE.][Illustration: CRYPT UNDER REFECTORY.]The conventual buildings were all placed on the south side of the churchand their arrangement, so far as they exist at the present time, isshown on the general plan (see p. 140). They were to a great extenterected at the same time as the church, that is during the thirteenthcentury, but were far from completed, and the account rolls show thatthey were not finished before the latter half[Illustration: THE PRIOR’S LODGING.]of the fifteenth century; but it is quite possible that some of thebuildings erected by Henry de Pudsey continued in use until the new oneswere ready for occupation. The chapter-house adjoins the south transeptand still retains its front over which one of the dormitory windows canyet be seen (see p. 141). To the south of the cloister are considerableremains of the refectory, raised, as at Durham, above a vaulted basement(see p. 142); it was lighted by a fine range of lancet windows on eitherside, and had a fireplace at the west end, and over it was anotherchamber the use of which is not apparent. By the west front of thechurch a guest-house for the poorer travellers was erected about 1464 intwo storeys, the lower one containing an oven; but the superior guestswere entertained in the Prior’s lodging. Although surrounded by earlierbuildings, the cloister was not completed until the second buildingepoch, the north walk occupying the site of the proposed south aisle ofthe nave, and the original doorway which had been built to be the southdoor of the church now crosses the east walk at the north end.The Prior’s lodgings (see p. 143) form an important and picturesquegroup of buildings standing by themselves to the south-east of thechurch, much in the same position as those of Durham. The vaultedbasement under the Prior’s hall and most of the substructure may be theearliest part of the conventual buildings remaining, and earlier in datethan the church, though much of the upper storey which contains thehall, camera and chapel belong to the subsequent periods. The lowbuilding at the west end containing a fireplace, which has beendescribed as the Prior’s kitchen, seems to be the building which,according to the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for 1836, was the \"spaciousentertainment room\" which Mr. Prebendary Spence erected for the use ofthe picnic parties which have in modern times pervaded the ruins. To thenorth of the Prior’s lodging, separated from it only in the basementstory, is the building mentioned in the account rolls for 1460 under thename of the \"Douglestour.\" How it came by this name is uncertain, but asthe lower part of the building was standing in 1328 when Douglas and hisScots made their raid across Northumberland to the banks of the Wear,it may have gained it through some association with him. The upperstorey of the tower formed the Prior’s camera and had at the north endan embayed window which commanded a charming prospect of the river andthe Cocken woods beyond. St. Godric was reputed to be the special patronof women, and this encorbelled window-base was known by them as the\"wishing-chair\"; but whatever was its charm, the spell was broken whenthe monks left the convent at the Reformation.At the Dissolution, as its income was less than £200 per annum, thePriory was treated as one of the lesser monasteries and suppressed in1536, when the site was granted to the Bishop of Durham, and thebuildings were left neglected; but their ruin was hastened by beingtreated as a stone-quarry. It does not appear that the Priory was everpurposely damaged otherwise, and it remains, after three centuries ofneglect, a more perfect and picturesque ruin than many of higherimportance and more beautiful architecture.MONKWEARMOUTH AND JARROWBY THE REV. D. S. BOUTFLOWER, M.A.It is almost impossible for the student of history to dissociate the twonames. In their earliest origin, in the ups and downs of their longexistence, and almost, if not quite, in their present conditions, thesister churches have met with one and the same experience. Theirfoundations were laid within the short period of ten years; they havearisen and decayed and revived (and that more than once) almostsimultaneously. They have shared together honour and neglect, wealth andpoverty. In all things and at all times the supreme desire of theirgreat founder has been fulfilled, and Monkwearmouth and Jarrow have beenone. Planted long ago as outposts of religious culture brought overseato the mouths of the Wear and the Tyne, the Churches of St. Peter andSt. Paul are now the centres of populous districts. Like other churchesaround them, they have their own busy church life; but, unlike to andabove the rest, these two stand as witnesses of the antiquity andcontinuity of the Christian faith in England. The churches where Bedeworshipped are still, at least in part, the churches of the twentiethcentury. The Gospels which he expounded are heard at their Communionservices to-day.Much of their history must be sought for and read in the buildingsthemselves. The first thing they will tell us is that they belong to avery early period of Saxon art. We have other evidence to assure us thatthese were[Illustration: MONKWEARMOUTH CHURCH.]among the first stone churches in England, and to tell how masons werebrought from the Continent to erect them. The singular height of thechurch at Monkwearmouth would lead us to the same conclusion. They werethus churches of quite a peculiar type, a type destined to undergo manymodifications in later times. In Monkwearmouth and Jarrow you are faceto face with the earliest form of English ecclesiastical architecture.We have no need to ask about the builders, or to wrangle over the dateof their foundation. There are darker and lighter periods in anyhistory; Monkwearmouth and Jarrow have, indeed, known much of both. Butthe light shines clearly enough upon their early days. For Monkwearmouthsaw the birth and Jarrow the death of the patriarch of Englishhistorians. Both places claim him as altogether their own. In the unitedconvent of St. Peter and St. Paul he spent practically the whole of hislife. Like all great men, he said little about himself; but he has muchto tell us about his twofold home. We turn gladly enough to the writingsof Bede, and specially to his Lives of the Abbots. We find ourselves atonce in the presence of one who knew how to observe and to describe, toadmire but never to condemn; one who loved to dwell upon the beautifulin the characters and works of men; a conscientious man withal, whosought out and told the truth. It is he that relates to us howMonkwearmouth and Jarrow grew.It was not fifty years since the Christian faith had been first taughtto the Northumbrians, and less than forty since its permanentestablishment by the preaching of the gentle Aidan, when there came backto his native kingdom of Northumbria a man of noble birth and culturedtraining, Biscop, called Benedict. He had wealth and interest at hiscommand, and, above all things, a fervent zeal concentrated upon adefinite purpose. It was an age that had recently witnessed a revival ofmonasticism; the life of contemplation had led on to study; orthodoxy[Illustration: OLD STONE AT MONKWEARMOUTH.]was the aim of trained thinkers; emotional minds dwelt on thedevotedness of the saintly life. Biscop himself was a traveller and astudent; he desired to found his own monastery, and to bring to ittreasures from foreign lands. His relative, King Ecgfrid, granted himfor this purpose an estate at the mouth of the Wear (A.D. 672). There hebuilt the Church of St. Peter, of which the western wall and porch stillremain. He brought with him (as we have seen) masons, and also glaziers,who restored to England a science that had long been lost. The buildingwas quite peculiar in its dimensions--some 60 feet long, 30 high, and 20broad. The singular proportions of Monkwearmouth Church, which have longpuzzled antiquaries, appear to be explained by a sermon in the nowprinted works of Bede, and possibly preached in the church itself onsome anniversary of its dedication. They correspond with those ofSolomon’s Temple, the units in this last case being cubits. There was atruly mathematical love of numbers in the mind of Bede, and he isevidently pleased to explain how the three dimensions above mentionedset forth in allegory the three Christian virtues of faith, hope, andcharity. The windows were small, and set high in the walls of thebuilding. You may see two of them, their splays adorned with balustershafts, in the western wall of the church. The south wall was adornedwith paintings representing scenes from the Gospel of St. John; a seriesof pictures illustrating the Apocalypse occupied the northern wall. Theroof was adorned with portraits of the Virgin and of the TwelveApostles; the presumption is that it was in the form of a flat ceiling.The whole arrangement of the building thus gave fair scope for light,shelter, and decoration.There was a second church soon afterwards erected at Monkwearmouth,dedicated to St. Mary. There were also dining-rooms and porches andsleeping apartments, in connection with the last of which there was anoratory dedicated to St. Lawrence. Where these other buildings lay isuncertain. Tradition says that they were to the west of the presentchurch. St. Mary’s Church was probably very much in this direction. Inthe fourteenth century \"the old kirk\" was used as a granary.The house at Monkwearmouth grew and prospered, a home of arts andscience and religion. There Bede began to acquire his wonderfulknowledge, and John the Chanter founded his great school of music. Sevenyears after its foundation (A.D. 681) expansion became a necessity, anda new grant of land was obtained, this time at Jarrow, on the south bankof the Tyne. Seventeen persons, clerical and lay, were sent thither,their leader being Ceolfrid, to whose care Bede, already for two yearsan inmate of the older monastery, was committed. Soon after this eventBiscop departed on his last visit to Rome, leaving his stalwart kinsmanEosterwini to rule at Monkwearmouth. He was absent for more than threeyears, an eventful time, during which both houses suffered grievouslyfrom a visitation of the plague. Eosterwini was its most notable victim,whilst at Jarrow nearly the whole convent was stricken down. At thatplace, as an anonymous writer informs us, only Ceolfrid and one boy,obviously Bede, were left to chant the daily services. The above factswill explain the delay in the consecration of the great church atJarrow, which, according to a contemporary inscription still preserved,was not dedicated till the fourth year of Ceolfrid’s presidency.Of this church only some stones now remain. A smaller church had,however, been first built and consecrated, and it is this which formsthe chancel of Jarrow Church to-day. Its dimensions do not suggest anyspecial meaning. Twenty-eight feet to the west of it, and lyingprecisely in the same right line, stood at one time a fabric preciselysimilar to that of St. Peter’s, Monkwearmouth, the same, apparently, inlength and breadth and height, and lighted by windows of the same typeand in the same position. Annexed to it on the north and south were anumber of apartments, undoubtedly to be identified with the _porches_ inBede’s account of Monkwearmouth, chambers opening by round-headed archesinto the church itself. The arches on the north side, and vestiges ofthree rooms on the south, remained as late as the year 1769. Probablyone such porch as this stood at the eastern end of the building; this weknow was the case at Monkwearmouth. These apartments, walled off as theywere from each other, would be used for prayer and study, and sometimesas places of sepulture. They were probably constructed in imitation ofthe chambers round Solomon’s temple.This, then, appears to have been the church which it took so long tocomplete, and in this building was set up the dedication stone abovementioned. It was erected and consecrated under the auspices of KingAldfrid (brother and successor to Ecgfrid), and the Abbot Ceolfrid.Biscop himself was still abroad, but soon afterwards returned toEngland, bringing with him many books and pictures, one series of which,depicting the events of our Lord’s life, was ranged as a crown round theChurch of St. Mary in the greater monastery; another, representing theGospel story by type and antitype, adorned the monastery and Church ofSt. Paul. Biscop’s last homecoming had its sorrows. He found Eosterwinidead, and his successor Sigfrid slowly dying of consumption. Then therecame to himself a stroke of paralysis. Very touching is the story toldus of the last days of the two Abbots. The greater man feels the greateranxiety. His much-prized library is not to be dispersed, but before allthings the unity of the double foundation is to be maintained. Beforehis end comes he appoints Ceolfrid to govern the united monastery of St.Peter and St. Paul.The narrative continues till the year 716, when the aged Ceolfridresigned his charge, and departed to die, as he hoped, at Rome. But thiswas not to be. His last moments were spent at Langres, near Lyons. Butone great work of Northumbrian art passed on by other hands toItaly--the splendid manuscript of the Vulgate, now known as the CodexAmiantinus, and preserved in the Medicean Library at Florence.Bede himself lived on in his old home till the year 735. The story ofhis end is too well known to need repetition here. Before his deathNorthumbria had fallen from its former glory. A period of darknesssupervenes, broken here and there by the lurid light of Danishinvasions. Yet the churches of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow lasted on,sacked, it might be, burned and desolated, but still saved from totaldestruction.The period of depression that followed the golden days of the twinmonasteries has left us but scanty memorials of their history. We beginto hear of times of insecurity, of attacks made upon the eastern coastof England by Danish pirates. The situations of the two churches would,under these circumstances, be distinctly against them. Jarrow is to thisday conspicuous; it is probably less well known that MonkwearmouthChurch stood for centuries upon the top of a hill. This is shown quiteclearly in the engraving of the year 1785. The sea rovers would taketheir own survey of the coast and its harbours, and would make for anyplace that offered promise of pillage. There is much good and rich landbetween the Wear and the Tyne, and the monks of early days wereassiduous cultivators. The country of Wilfrid and Biscop and Bede was nouncivilized or neglected part of the world. To a pagan race there wouldbe no impediment in the form of religious scruples. The wealth of theChurch would but invite the spoilers to their prey.And so the Danes came first to Northern England, to begin with, somewhattentatively, in the year 793, harrying the island of Lindisfarne,plundering its monastery, and burning the church. The next year theirships put into the Tyne. On the hill overlooking the slake, just wherethat river receives its tributary the Don, stood the monastery ofJarrow, Egfrid’s Port lying immediately below it. Here they landed, andtook such booty as they found. But the people of the neighbourhoodrallied, and drove back the invaders to their ships. Few of them madegood their escape, for the wind was against them. The storm came up intothe river, and the fugitives were driven to the shore, where they andtheir chieftain, Ragner Lodbrog, met with the vengeance they deserved.It is quite clear that the lesson thus given was not forgotten. We hearno more of Danish invasions for well on to sixty years. When theyrecommenced, they were directed elsewhere. In the year 851 the Daneslanded in Sheppey, and this time they came to stay. The chroniclers havemuch to say about _the Army_; but it was not till the year 875 that itmarched into Northern England, and then probably not much beyond York;it moved south two years later. But meanwhile there had no doubt beenmany a raid upon the settlements on the coast. The year 866 was markedby one of the most serious of these. At that date Hingvar and Hubbaburned the church of Monkwearmouth. The traces of this conflagration arestill distinctly perceptible. Again in the year 875 the fleet of Halfdanwas in the Tyne. Contemporaneously with this event took place the flightfrom Lindisfarne, and the commencement of the journeyings of the body ofSt. Cuthbert.How the Danish power was driven back by Alfred, how his wise policyreclaimed the half of his kingdom, is a well-known part of our nationalhistory. The final triumph was not so much one of war as of peace. Thewisdom of a very great King effected much; the growing strength ofrecovering Christianity did the rest. Never did any ruler so effectuallycombine the forces of secular and spiritual power, or hold them moretruly in balance and co-operation. The invaders became settlers, andhave left this part of their history in the names of their new homes.This is especially true of Lincolnshire; then, hardly less decidedly, ofYork. But north of the Tees the English population simply retained landswhich they had never ceased to occupy. Danish place-names in the countyof Durham are few and far between.[Illustration: ORNAMENTAL STONEWORK, MONKWEARMOUTH CHURCH.]This is so much evidence--and it is worth something--in favour of thesupposition that the sister churches of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow werenot left to permanent ruin. The population of the neighbourhood was, andremained, English, and would no doubt be warmly attached to the ancientsanctuaries. Their hearts and minds would be as faithful to the sacredmemories of the past as were those of the wanderers who guarded the bodyof St. Cuthbert. That there was no revolution in the history of thisparticular district may be presumed from the silence which veils thispart of the story of their two great churches. The theory here advocatedappears to be further confirmed by the one incident recorded at thisperiod in connection with the church of Jarrow.The old faith in the potency of the relics of the saints remainedunshaken through all periods of sunshine or of gloom. Respect for thepast and for the good clings to the devoted Churchman of every age; itmay sometimes even be strong enough to overpower his moral principle. Itwas so undoubtedly in the case of Ælfred, a monk of Durham in the earlypart of the eleventh century. This man conceived himself to be divinelycommissioned to visit the sites of ancient monasteries and to gathertogether the remains of departed martyrs and confessors. He was verysuccessful in his quest. Hexham and Melrose were laid undercontribution, and Jarrow was not likely to be forgotten. To it he paidan annual visit on the anniversary of the death of Bede. At least oncehe prolonged his stay for several days, fasting and praying in thechurch. Then one morning he departed at a very early hour, and hereturned no more. What he had done may be inferred from the assurancewith which he stated in after-years that the remains of Bede wereresting in the grave of St. Cuthbert. From what we know of the man andof the age there seems little room for dispute about the matter: itappears, moreover, to have been corroborated at a later date by visualevidence.The story is of interest to us mainly as bearing witness to the factthat in the year 1022 the church of Jarrow remained a popular centre ofworship. In the case of Monkwearmouth history and legend alike fail us;we must judge for ourselves. The tower of the church was evidently builtat two distinct periods. The porch and the parvise over it appear tobelong to the age of the founder. They also show traces of the fires ofthe Danes. This is not the case with the superstructure. Incontestablyof Saxon work, it belongs to the same period which saw the erection ofat least four church towers in the valley of the Tyne. As it exhibits notraces of the burning of the year 866, its date and theirs must belooked for somewhere in the next two centuries. The reign of theNorthumbrian Guthred (A.D. 884-894) has been ascertained to be a periodwhen relations between Church and State were more than ordinarilyfriendly. At this time the tower of Monkwearmouth Church may well havebeen completed. It can hardly have been built at a much later date, forthere is other and different work in the[Illustration: JARROW CHURCH.]same church which appears to belong to the age before the Conquest. Themodern arch between nave and chancel rises on its south side from anancient substructure, of which one feature is the cushion moulding atits base. There is something here begun by Anglo-Saxon masons, butcarried out apparently by Norman builders. It was possibly a work of thereign of Edward the Confessor, and apparently implies somecontemporaneous reconstruction of the early porch or chancel.Subject, then, to the chances of time and of warfare, the churches ofMonkwearmouth and Jarrow still carried on their existence. The latterwas certainly in use at the date of the Conquest. This was a period oftrouble and disaster. Oswulf, the Earl of Northumberland, is displaced,and soon after murders his successor. Gospatric next buys the earldom,and forthwith rebels. The Conqueror marches northward in person, andappoints Robert Cummin to the vacant office. He, too, is assassinated inthe city of Durham. This event is followed by the King’s return, and thewholesale devastation of the lands north of York. Ethelwin the Bishop,accompanied by his canons, flees northward with the body of St.Cuthbert. They rest for a night in the church at Jarrow. Their pursuersfollow on their track and set the building on fire. Northumbria isdevastated by Norman and Scottish enemies at once; and for nine yearsthe land lies waste. During this period we may well believe that bothour churches stood unroofed and desolate; their walls, on the otherhand, certainly resisted the flames, and were preserved to be ere longthe home of a new band of settlers.       *       *       *       *       *The Norman Conquest brought in its train a very distinct revival ofmonasticism. This was part of the general movement in favour of orderand authority which then prevailed. It came, no doubt, originally fromRome. It was, in fact, the characteristic of Rome from very early days.It made itself felt in the eleventh century by the growth of themilitary spirit, and later on by the gradual development of law. Itaffected more immediately the religious side of national life. Clericalcelibacy began to be enforced, and the foundation of monasteries wasencouraged. The foreigners took the lead in this matter, amongst themWalcher of Lorraine, Bishop of Durham. Hearing of a small party ofmissionary monks who had just arrived at Monkchester (now Newcastle), hemade haste to invite them to settle in his own territory at Jarrow. Weare told that he gave them the churches there (the plural number issignificant). They were soon joined by others who had followed them fromthe South--the men of the North stood aloof; they had at this time goodreason to be suspicious of Southern visitors. The numbers of the monksgrew, and their patron enlarged their estate to meet their increasedneeds. Besides a large property in land on both sides of the Tyne, theyreceived a grant of the church of Monkwearmouth. Briers and trees werestanding within its walls; much the same thing was probably true ofJarrow. But they set to work with energy to repair and to acquire and toestablish.What they did at Monkwearmouth we are not able to say. Probably theyextended the eastern porch into the form of a chancel. Two centurieslater that chancel attained its present peculiar form--long andnarrow--as became the custom in this part of England; it is alsodecidedly lofty, being apparently intended thus to correspond with theancient nave. Undoubtedly respect was from the first shown to those whodesigned the original church. The same right sentiment may be observedmuch more evidently in the case of Jarrow, with which as their first andmore important possession Bishop Walcher’s monks proceeded to deal atonce.We have mentioned above the existence of two churches at Jarrow, andhave observed that there exists written corroboration of this. Thesmaller church which stood to the east is the chancel of the presentbuilding. Twenty-eight feet to the west of it was the termination ofthe nave or main block of the western church, built precisely on thequite mathematical lines of the elder fabric at Monkwearmouth. We maypresume of this building what we know to have been the case at St.Peter’s, that there was a porch behind the altar, a building, that is tosay, with three walls and one open side. Such a building still exists inthe chancel of the Saxon church at Escomb, near Bishop Auckland.Assuming that the porch at Jarrow was like that at Escomb, square, andof proportionately larger dimensions, there would be a space of somethirteen feet intervening between it and the eastern church. It was herethat the Norman builders would be disposed to erect their tower, andhere the tower was accordingly built, not foursquare after the Normanmodel, but in an oblong form. The site occupies a rectangle of thirteenby twenty-one feet. The lower stages of this structure are essentiallymassive and very distinctly Norman in character. The highest storey, onthe other hand, less well executed as some think, has its ownornateness; it was probably erected in the succeeding generation. If so,we understand the better the set-back of its northern and southernsides; the architect employed had, no doubt, his own opinion to theeffect that the tower ought to have been square.[Illustration: EARLY ENGLISH SNAKES, MONKWEARMOUTH CHURCH.]The principle adopted by Bishop Walcher’s monks appears to have beenthat of reverent adaptation to immediate needs. They wished to repairand to add, but not to destroy. Had their stay at their new home beenprolonged, the case would in time have been altered. Large medievalbuildings would have taken the place of the more primitive originalstructures. But their sojourn at Jarrow lasted for only eight years. Inthe year 1083 Bishop William of St. Carileph transferred them to hiscathedral. The extruded canons were placed at Auckland and Darlington,and the Evesham Benedictines occupied the mother-church of the diocese.It was all done in haste. It was repented of, no doubt, at leisure. Inthe enthusiasm of the moment Bishop William founded the one and onlyabbey in the Bishopric of Durham. His successors, we may well believe,deplored what was politically and ecclesiastically a great mistake. Butwhat was done could not be undone by anything less than a revolution.The Abbey of Durham grew and was strong. The magnificence of itsbuildings tells of the wealth of the builders. The Durham Household Bookspeaks of the stir and pomp and cheerfulness of its daily life.Meanwhile, the two more ancient sanctuaries were reduced to theinsignificant condition of Cells. They were left with their old estates,each under the rule of a master, appointed or removed by the Prior ofDurham at his will. Each master had one monk with him for company,sometimes two, and very rarely three. The masters appear to have takenbut little interest in the spiritual affairs of their churches. Thenaves of these buildings were considered the property of theparishioners, who executed repairs at their own cost; an ill-paidstipendiary, called the chaplain or parish priest, discharged allparochial duties. The church of Jarrow had its chapels at Wallsend, atShields, and at Westoe. The first named of these was left very much toitself; the very altar-fees of the other chapels, as well as those ofthe churches, were the perquisite of the master, while the services ofthe chaplain were remunerated at very much the same rate as those of themonastery barber.The result as regards the fabrics was much what might have beenexpected. The nave at Monkwearmouth was left to itself; that at Jarrowwas at some time extended so as to include the ground occupied by itseastern porch. The other porches or chapels that once flanked thisbuilding may have served for a while as parts of the parish church; thenthey fell one after another by a lingering process of decay. On theother hand, Monkwearmouth Church was in course of time enlarged; a northaisle was added in the thirteenth century; its very pleasing doorway hasbeen fortunately preserved. About the same time two rather large windowswere set to lighten the east end of the nave of Jarrow.The case was different with the conventual part of the two churches. AtMonkwearmouth, as we have seen, the choir was made long and lofty. TwoDecorated windows were placed on its southern side; a third, similar tothe others, stood in the north wall, all traces of which seem to havebeen destroyed in quite recent times. The date of these windows is fixedby an entry in the account rolls under the year 1347. A little later aneast window of five lights was erected; it has been reproduced from itsfragments, and is not without merit. The design at Monkwearmouth is,however, far better than the workmanship.In the case of Jarrow it was not necessary to find a new chancel; theold eastern church was quite sufficiently roomy. What was required waslight, and this was provided first by a north-east window and an eastwindow, each of three lights, and afterwards by two additional windowsof three lights, one on each side of the western end of the chancel. Thelatest of these was inserted in the year 1350.The two houses conducted their financial affairs in an easy way. Theywanted enough to live upon, but had no further ambitions. They did notdevelop their estates, and were careless as to their fisheries. Jarrowwas the richer house, but Monkwearmouth was reckoned the healthier;thither came the monks of Durham to enjoy the bracing air. Once, at anyrate, Jarrow had to contribute to their maintenance. The usual donationswere made--subscriptions to subsidies and to the needs of scholars atOxford. A singular entry is often repeated in the rolls--the cost ofwine for the parishioners’ Communion.       *       *       *       *       *Such was the uneventful life of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth till therevolution of 1536, which brought an end to the existence of the smallermonasteries. These two were valued at £38 14s. 4d. and £26 9s. 9d.respectively.The property of both the cells passed thenceforth into lay hands, andthe churches became poorer still. To Jarrow was preserved the meagreendowment of ten marks; to Monkwearmouth two marks less. The formerchurch had, moreover, Easter offerings and a small parsonage. Theincumbents of both had, of course, an uncertain income from fees. Noattempt to mend matters was made till the commencement of the nineteenthcentury.Before that period had arrived the neglected churches had at last fallenquite into decay. The parishioners had had to do something; what theydid was to destroy the nave of Jarrow, and the southern (or Saxon) wallof Monkwearmouth. These demolitions took place in 1782 and 1806respectively. The result of the alterations and rebuildings no doubtcommended itself to those then concerned with such matters. We find apicture of the new Monkwearmouth Church accompanied with a note of muchsatisfaction in a contemporary number of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_.Restorations followed in 1861 and 1873, but they could not give back thepast. What was spared has been treated with reverence. The west front ofMonkwearmouth still remains. The church, now apparently sunk into ahollow, is surrounded by poor and crowded tenements, built upon ballastbrought from the Thames. The medieval chancel is there, its restoredwindows now filled with Kempe’s beautiful glass. The music of itsservices is worthy of the church of John the Chanter. Only we regret theloss of the Saxon Church as it once stood upon its hill overlookingriver and sea. Jarrow has been more fortunate; it still crowns the hillabove its wide slake--a landmark well known to all those who use thewaterways of the Tyne. It, too, has its points of interest, its Saxonchancel and its Norman tower. Much, of course, is missing in bothplaces. But there is still more than enough to attract and to fascinatethe mind of the Englishman and the Christian, who looks back to theglories of that good old time that gave to Northumbria and to the worldthe life of the one man that was Venerable--the learning and the laboursof Bede.THE PARISH CHURCHES OF DURHAMBY WILFRID LEIGHTONArchitecturally, the parish churches of Durham are best described as ofthe \"homely order,\" and one may search the county in vain for anoft-recurring and distinctive feature, such as the graceful spires ofNorthamptonshire, or the splendid Perpendicular towers, whichdistinguish so many of the churches of Somerset. In the country ofBenedict Biscop and the Venerable Bede it is natural that we should lookfor other matters of interest than striking architecture, andundoubtedly many of the churches carry evidence of a high antiquity,though only perhaps a fragment of dog-tooth moulding breaking throughlath and plaster restoration of the eighteenth century.Two churches, Jarrow and Monkwearmouth, are no less interesting for theSaxon remains which they contain than for their association with theearly Christian Fathers of the North. Both these churches date from thelatter part of the seventh century. At the time of their erectionTheodore of Tarsus, to whom the division of the country into parishes isgenerally attributed, was Archbishop of Canterbury; but it would not atthis early date be correct to describe them as parish churches, for itwas not until the decay of the brotherhoods to which they were attachedthat they ceased to be other than the chapels of their respectivemonasteries.In another part of this volume full justice has been done to theseearly churches, but some reference must be made here to the church ofEscomb, in the west of the county. It is perhaps of an equally earlydate and a remarkably perfect example of a church of the period. Verylittle is known of its early history, but after the Dissolution it wasregarded as a chapel-of-ease to St. Andrew’s, Auckland. In 1879 it hadfallen into disuse, a new church having been built at some distance. Butupon the \"re-discovery\" of the nature of the old building, in that year,funds were at once raised for its repair.The church consists of a square chancel, a nave, and a porch as a lateraddition. The church has undoubtedly been built with stones from theRoman camp of Binchester, many of which show the diamond broaching.Professor Baldwin Brown is of the opinion that the chancel arch, whichis the most striking feature of the interior, was removed bodily fromthe camp and set up in pre-Conquest times in its present position.On the south side of the chancel there are two original windows, withsemicircular heads, cut out of single blocks, and jambs batteringinwards. There are two original windows on the north side with squareheads. The sills of these windows are thirteen feet from the floorlevel, and another window in the west end is placed still higher. Atlater dates the walls have been pierced with other windows, two in thesouth wall of the nave, one in the west gable, one in the east end, andone in the south wall of the chancel. Between the two original windowson the south is a \"Saxon\" sundial. The original entrances were in thenorth and south walls of the nave, and there is a later doorway in thechancel. A fragment of an early cross is preserved in the church.Contemporary with these churches there existed at Hartlepool a monastichouse said by Bede to have been founded by Heiu, the first Northumbriannun, and subsequently extended by St. Hilda, before her transition toWhitby in 657.Although continued after this date, its history during the period of theDanish invasion is lost. The present Church of St. Hilda is mentioned inthe confirmatory charter to Guisborough Priory of Bishop Pudsey in 1195,and in those of several of his successors, and was most likely includedin the original grant with the churches of Hart and Stranton, of whichit was a dependent chapel. In 1308 Bishop Bek, as a reward for thecontinual devotion, charity, and hospitality of the Prior and convent ofGuisborough, granted them the indulgence, that in the church of Hart andchapel of Hartlepool, service should, after that date, be perpetuallyperformed by a canon of Guisborough.Statutes for the government of the church were drawn up by theCorporation of Hartlepool in 1599, and appear in the Corporationrecords, whence the following extract:     \"Ytt ys ordeyned, that whosoever of this town dothe shott att or     within the churche or churche steple of thys town, with gun,     crosbowe, or anie other shott for the kyllinge of any dove, pigeon,     or anie other foule, shall paye, for every suche offence, to the     use of the town. 12.d.\"In 1600 the number of \"pues or stalls\" was thirty-three.The first church, though much restored, is the one which still remains,and the finest of the parish churches in the North. Standing on highground, the impressive landmark formed by its massive tower andcrocketed pinnacles, over many miles of land and water, has beenreferred to with admiration by every historian of the county.     \"The church of Hartlepool differs from most ancient churches in     being throughout one design, carried out at one time.... It tells,     as authentically as any written document could, of the rapid growth     and prosperity which preceded its erection. In the enthusiasm to     which success gives birth, the merchants of Hartlepool said: ‘We     will build a church.’ From the first they contemplated a splendid     design, and this they executed worthily.\"--BOYLE.The church stands to the north-west of the site of St. Hilda’sFoundation. Its tower is its most striking characteristic. At an earlydate the tower must have shown signs of weakness, and the enormousbuttresses which increase its picturesqueness so much were added. Theseadditions are generally ascribed to the year 1230, and the entrancearch, with a very beautiful but much decayed chevron moulding, cutthrough the south buttress of the west side, is of the same date. Thetower is of three stages, and the south-west corner forms a turret,through which a staircase leads to the roof. The clerestory windows haveformerly been of three lights each, now built into one, and are veryfine. The original capitals remain, but all the shafts have gone.The west, or main entrance, has been built up. The nave is supported byfive clustered pillars on each side, with pointed arches. In the wall ofthe south aisle is a piscina. The greater part of the chancel is modern.Several chantries were attached to the church before the dissolution ofthe monasteries, but the monumental remains are few.In the churchyard is a large tomb, which was formerly enclosed withinthe walls of the ancient chancel, before the latter was taken down. Itis generally ascribed to the De Bruses, and the armorial shields on thesides, each charged with a lion rampant, confirm the suggestion.Durham possesses another very good example of Early English architecturein the parish church of Darlington, dedicated to St. Cuthbert. Itconsists of a chancel, north and south transepts, a nave with aisles,and a central tower crowned by a spire. That it stands on a site ofgreat antiquity is proved by the discovery, in 1866, during restoration,of fragments of three pre-Conquest crosses, which are now preserved inthe church. In the charter of Styr, son of Ulf, which is included in arecord called by Symeon, the \"Ancient Chartulary of the Church,\" thereis given to St. Cuthbert \"the vill which is called Dearthingtun, withsac and soc,\" and Symeon again mentions Darlington as one of the placesto which the secularized monks of Durham were removed in 1083 byWilliam de St. Carileph. On the authority of Geoffry de Coldingham, theerection of the church has been ascribed to Bishop Pudsey, and the dateto 1190-95.The principal entrance is in the west front, set in a richly mouldedarch, with a trefoil-headed niche above. In the second stage of thefront is an arcade of five arches, and the third stage has three arches,all with dividing shafts. The arches in the second stage are piercedalternately with lancet lights. The walls of the aisle were greatlyaltered about the middle of the fourteenth century, and all thesquare-headed windows belong to this period, no features dating from theoriginal erection of the church remaining except the doorways. The northdoorway has been greatly restored, and the south doorway was originallycovered by a porch; it has a niche above. The clerestory has an arcadeof twelve arches pierced with four lancet windows on each side. Bothtransepts and the chancel are of two stages, divided by string courses;but the south transept is more enriched than the north, both internallyand externally. Buttresses divide the walls of the chancel into threebays, and the walls and ends of the transepts are similarly divided intotwo bays each. Those buttresses at the junctions of the transepts andthe chancel, owing to their great proportion, have much the appearanceof corner turrets. The spire and the higher stage of the tower are ofthe same date as the walls of the aisles. Longstaffe says of the spire:\"On July 17, 1750, this beautiful spire, considered the highest andfinest in the North of England, was rent.... The storm occasionedfifteen yards of the spire to be taken down and rebuilt in 1752....Unfortunately the mason omitted the moulding at the angles of the newpart.\"Incidentally it should be noted that Durham is one of the counties inwhich spires are comparatively rare.The tower is supported by four arches on clustered shafts, and the naveis divided from its aisle by four arches on each side. The east wall ofthe chancel is modern. Three sedilia of the Decorated period occupy theusual position in the chancel. In one of the windows on the east side ofthe south transept occurs the only instance of the dog-tooth ornament inthe interior of the church, and there is a piscina in both of the sidewalls of the same transept.Darlington is the only church in the county which retains a rood-loft.On the south of the chancel is the vestry, which has been greatlymodernized. The only monumental effigy is that of an unknown lady with abook in her hand. It dates from the early thirteenth century, and isplaced at the west end of the nave.After the two churches last mentioned, the church at Sedgefield,dedicated to St. Edmund the Bishop, but formerly dedicated to theVirgin, is probably the finest in the county. The nave and chancel datefrom the Early English period. The tower is very fine, of Perpendiculardate and of three stages, crowned by battlemented parapets and smallspirelets standing on angle buttresses. The Rev. J. F. Hodgson is of theopinion that it was intended to crown the tower with an open lantern, asat St. Nicholas’ Cathedral, Newcastle.There are two transepts; the south contains the chapel of St. Thomas,and in its east wall are two piscinas, one of which is trefoil-headed;and in the south wall are two pointed recesses occupied by muchmutilated male and female effigies, the latter dating from the laterfourteenth century. The north transept contains the Chapel of St.Katherine, and is now known as the Hardwick porch. Two of its ancientwindows still remain, and fix its date as 1328. The east window isfilled with Late Decorated tracery. The nave is divided from the aislesby three pointed arches, supported by clustered pillars on mouldedbases. The capitals are richly carved and very interesting.The font is octagonal and of Frosterley marble, dating from the end ofthe fifteenth century, and charged on each side with armorial shields,most likely carved in the seventeenth century. The stall work of thechancel is ascribed to the latter part of the seventeenth century, andthe rich chancel screen to a slightly earlier date.On the north side of the chancel is the grave cover of Andrew deStanley, first master of Greatham Hospital.Two interesting brasses of skeletons in shrouds are preserved in thevestry, and were originally inlaid in one slab. Another small brass isin the south transept. It is considered to be one of the earliest inEngland, and represents a lady in loose robe with tight sleeves andwimple and hood. There is another brass to the memory of William Hoton,engraved with a helmet and crest of three trefoils.Of the five bells, one is of pre-Reformation date, bearing theinscription \"✠ TRINITATE SACRA FIAT HEC CAMPANA BEATA,\" and the arms ofRhodes and Thornton.The church at Staindrop, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, was muchmutilated by restorations in 1849, but its sepulchral monuments tomembers of the Neville family are unrivalled.Parts of the walls of the nave are of pre-Reformation date, and two ofthe original windows still remain. The north and south aisles were addedto the original structure in the twelfth century, when the nave wallswere pierced by three arches on each side, supported on cylindricalpillars, with capitals carved in different foliage designs. During thefollowing century the plan of the church was altered, and an additionalbay added to the west end of the nave, north and south transepts thrownout, and the tower erected. The tower was of three stages, probablycrowned by a wooden spire, taken down in 1408, when a fourth stage wasadded. Being built on the original corbel-tables, and overhanging thesubstructure, it gives the whole a very heavy appearance. About thesame time the original high-pitched roofs were lowered to the almostflat roofs which now exist, and the clerestory of the nave built. Beforethe date of the latter alterations extensive changes had been made inthe church during the fourteenth century, when Ralph, Lord Neville,under licence of the Prior and convent of Durham, endowed threechantries. The original south aisle and transept were removed, and thepresent south aisle, which is much wider than the nave, erected. At thesouth-east angle of the aisle a small porch or vestry projects, whichwas intended for the use of the priests officiating in the chantries.Shortly after these alterations, the symmetry of the church beingdestroyed, a new north aisle and transept, of similar dimensions, butmuch inferior work, were erected. The ancient vestry opening from thechancel, with _domus inclusa_ above, is very interesting.Staindrop is the only church in the county in which the pre-Reformationchancel screen remains, but the rood-loft which surmounted it has beendestroyed. The font is octagonal, and of Teesdale marble, decorated witharmorial bearings, and may date from the latter part of the fourteenthcentury.The first of the effigies before referred to is that of a lady, and liesin a recess in the south aisle. It is ascribed to Isabel de Neville,wife of Robert FitzMeldred, Lord of Raby. \"The costume is an excellentexample of the dress of a gentlewoman of Western Europe in the secondhalf of the thirteenth century and beginning of the fourteenth.\"Sepulchral effigies of females of this early date are extremely rare.The general resemblance of this effigy to that of Aveline, Countess ofLancaster, in Westminster Abbey, who died in 1269, is very striking.The second effigy in point of date is attributed to Euphemia, mother ofRalph, Lord Neville, founder of the chantries and builder of the southaisle, in which it lies in an enriched recess. The third, a femaleeffigy, is also in the same aisle, and though no doubt representing oneof the Neville family, its exact identity is a matter of somecontroversy. It dates from the fourteenth century, and the remainingeffigy in the aisle--that of a boy--is of the same date.A remarkably fine altar-tomb, with effigies of Ralph Neville, first Earlof Westmorland, and his wives--Margaret, daughter of Hugh, Earl ofStafford, and Joan, daughter of John of Gaunt--has been described as themost splendid in the North of England.The Earl is dressed in a rich suit of full armour, with collar of SS.,and the ladies in kirtles, with jewelled girdles and sideless surcoatsand mantles. Their arms have been destroyed. The Earl died in 1426.The remaining monument is to the memory of Henry Neville, fifth Earl ofWestmorland, who died in 1564, and his two first wives--Anne, daughterof Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, and Jane, daughter of Sir RichardCholmondeley.The monument is of oak, and ornamented with effigies of the Earl’schildren and armorial bearings. The Earl is dressed in armour, and aninscription states that the tomb was made in the year 1560.In addition to the churches already mentioned, the south and south-eastdistricts of the county are rich in churches, worthy, if space availed,of more than passing notice.At Barnard Castle the church dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin carriesevidence that it was in early times a large and important edifice, andin the twelfth century consisted of chancel and nave, with north andsouth aisles. Rebuilding and structural alterations were carried outfrom time to time until the middle of the fifteenth century, when bothtransepts were rebuilt. The vestry is probably of the same date, and thechancel arch, which is very fine, slightly earlier. The tower is modern,and replaced a fifteenth-century structure. The floor of the chancel ismuch higher than that of the nave, and evidence of a similar differencein levels is found at Lanchester Church. Two arched recesses, one ofwhich contains an effigy of a priest, are in the north wall of the northtransept, and a mutilated piscina is in the south wall of the sametransept. In this church there were four chantry chapels dedicatedrespectively to St. Catherine, St. Helen, St. Margaret, and the Trinity,and referred to in old records, but their exact position cannot now beascertained.The church at Winston has several sepulchral brasses, but, with theexception of the walls of the chancel, which contain two remarkablesingle-light windows, and the arcade and north wall of the nave, ismodern.Nearer to Darlington is the Church of St. Andrew at Haughton-le-Skerne.The whole of the edifice is of one period, and dates from the secondquarter of the twelfth century. Its most striking feature is a massivetower, surmounted by a battlemented turret of later date. The richlycarved woodwork of Restoration date is interesting. In the east wall ofthe nave is a monumental brass, and a stone slab in the floor of thetower commemorates the death of Elizabeth Naunton, Prioress of Neasham,1488-89.The only medieval pulpit in the county is in the Church of St. Michaelat Heighington. It is of oak, and carved with the linen pattern designand flowing tracery, with an inscription on the cornice.The church dates from the twelfth century, and considerable remains ofthat date still exist.At Aycliffe, the Church of St. Andrew is substantially a building ofNorman date. It now consists of a chancel, nave with north and southaisles, south porch, and western tower, the latter and the south aisledating from the beginning of the thirteenth century. Remains of severalpre-Conquest crosses are in the church and churchyard.Gainford Church, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, is all of one period,and with a few exceptions dates from the middle of the thirteenthcentury. It contains several interesting brasses. The same may be saidof the Church of St. Edwin at Coniscliffe, which has a very interestingcarved slab above the south door.The Church of All Saints at Hurworth contains several effigies, but wasalmost entirely rebuilt in 1870. The Church of St. Mary at Egglescliffehas portions of Early Norman date, but the chancel dates from the laterPerpendicular period, and has a fine east window of five lights. On thesouth side of the nave is a fourteenth-century chapel, with a sepulchraleffigy of a man in rich armour in a niche in the outer wall.St. Cuthbert at Redmarshall is a modest structure, but contains twointeresting alabaster effigies of Thomas de Langton and Sybil, his wife,placed in a fifteenth-century chantry chapel on the south side of thenave.Both Norton and Billingham contain churches of great interest. Theformer has portions of pre-Conquest date, and was one of the churches towhich William de St. Carileph removed the monks of Durham in 1083. Thechurch, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, contains a nave and sideaisles, chancel, north and south porches, and central tower. The latteroriginally rose no higher than the ridges of the main roofs, and formeda chamber, the floor of which has been removed. Beneath the tower is avery fine effigy of a knight in chain armour, surmounted by a crocketedcanopy. The chancel was rebuilt in the thirteenth century, and the upperstage of the tower is probably of the same period.At Billingham the church is dedicated to St. Cuthbert. The tower is ofpre-Conquest date, and has certain points of resemblance to the higherstage of that at St. Peter’s, Monkwearmouth. Several fragments ofpre-Conquest crosses are built into the south wall of the tower, and thechurch has three memorial brasses.In Durham City, St. Oswald’s, the parish church of Elvet, has awell-recorded history, and was the subject of an amusing dispute betweenthe Bishop Philip de Pictavia and the Prior and monks of Durham, arisingfrom a charter[Illustration: NORTON CHURCH.]of Henry II. confirming to the latter \"Elvet, with the church of thesame town.\"On the accession of Philip--the last vicar, Richard de Coldingham,having recently died--     \"Four of the monks from St. Cuthbert’s held possession of the     church, and lived constantly in it.     \"The Bishop ... issued a command that the monks should quit the     church. This they refused to do; whereupon the Bishop employed as     many as thirty watchmen, who guarded all the doors and windows, so     that no food should reach the monks in the church. After two or     three days, two of the monks could endure the fast no longer, and     abandoned their charge. Their example was shortly followed by the     others.... Four days were occupied by negotiations, at the end of     which the Bishop confirmed the possession of the church to them     ‘for their own proper uses.’\"--BOYLE.The church is of various periods, and has a very good clerestory with afine open-work parapet, and a tower of more than ordinary interest, witha stone staircase in the thickness of the wall, roofed with thirteenthand fourteenth century grave-covers.St. Margaret’s and St. Giles’s are two city churches of interest. Bothhave several pre-Reformation bells, and of the latter--     \"an interesting fact in the history of this church is that St.     Godric, during the period he resided in Durham, was an attendant at     its services, and at length became doorkeeper and     bellringer.\"--BOYLE.Pittington Church, dedicated to St. Lawrence, is one of the mostinteresting churches in the central district of the county. Portions ofthe western bays of the nave are of Norman date. In the twelfth centurygreat structural alterations were made to the original church, which hadconsisted of a nave and chancel only. The tower belongs to this period,and the wonderful north arcade pierced through the original north wallof the nave. The arcading of the wall forms four bays, and a fifth wasbuilt as an elongation to the east, the original chancel being takendown and rebuilt. The pillars are alternately cylindrical, ornamentedwith spiral bands, and octagonal with flutings. The arches are of twoorders, ornamented towards the nave with chevron mouldings, and restingon octagonal cushioned capitals. During the thirteenth century thechurch was enlarged by a south aisle being built. The tower arch is alsoof this period. The date of the clerestory is uncertain. In 1846 thechancel was taken down, and the south aisle entirely, and north aislepartly, rebuilt, and the nave again lengthened. In the splays of anearly window in the north wall of the nave are remains of two wallpaintings.     \"They are undoubtedly portions of a complete series of paintings     occupying the whole interior of the first Norman church.... They     represent two incidents in the life of St. Cuthbert--viz., his     consecration by Archbishop Theodore, and his vision at the table of     the Abbess Ælfleda....\"--FOWLER.There is an interesting grave-cover in the floor beneath the tower,bearing an inscription to the memory of Christian the Mason, acontemporary of Bishop Pudsey. Also an effigy attributed to the familyof Fitz-Marmaduke, Lords of Horden, and several interesting monumentalstones.All the bells, three in number, are of pre-Reformation date.The important Church of St. Michael at Houghton-le-Spring dates almostentirely from the thirteenth century, but stands on the site of a muchearlier erection, of which a portion still remains in the north wall ofthe chancel, containing a square-headed doorway and round-headed window.The church, as now existing, consists of a chancel with north and southtransepts, nave with north and south aisles, south porch, and centraltower. In the north wall of the chancel is an arcade of eight lancets,much restored, and opening from the south side is an unusualtwo-storeyed erection, which, it is presumed, had some connection withthe ancient Gild of Holy Trinity and St. Mary, established in the churchin 1476.The windows in the gables of the transepts are modern. In the east wallof the south transept are three tall lancets and two in thecorresponding wall of the north transept. In a recess in the south wallof the former is a roughly carved and much-weathered effigy of a man inarmour, dating from the thirteenth century, and a similar effigy oflater date and superior workmanship lies in the same transept, togetherwith the altar-tomb of Bernard Gilpin, \"the apostle of the North,\" and abrass to the memory of Margery, wife of Richard Bellasis of Henknoll,dated 1587. Both the transepts contained chantry chapels before theReformation, and in both are piscinas in the usual position.The arcading of the nave is very fine, and supported on clustered piers.The east and west windows are Decorated insertions and contain goodtracery. The lower stage of the tower and its supporting arches arecontemporary with the main body of the church, the upper stage is modernand with the present spire replaced the ancient spire of wood.At Dalton, the Church of St. Andrew, is a very simple structure, butcontains an unusual sundial, consisting of carved stone figures on theinside of the north wall of the nave, upon which the time is marked by asunbeam passing through a window.St. Mary’s, Easington, has suffered much at the hands of restorers, butstill remains a most interesting church. The whole of the presentedifice, with the exception of the tower, which is of Norman work, datesfrom the thirteenth century. The nave is separated from its aisle byfour pointed arches on either side resting on piers, alternatelyoctagonal and cylindrical. The clerestory is good and has four lancetwindows on each side. With the exception of the original round-headedwindows in the tower, all the windows are restorations. The presententrance is at the south of the tower, the original entrance to the navehaving been built up. The woodwork of the chancel is interesting. Thereare two fine male and female effigies of the Fitz-Marmaduke family inthe chancel, but their identity is uncertain. They date from the latterpart of the thirteenth century.In the north-eastern quarter of the county there are the churches ofJarrow and Monkwearmouth already referred to, and several other edificesof ancient foundation, but so much restored and modernized as to retainfew of their original features.[Illustration: BOLDON SPIRE.]This may be said of the church at Whitburn, which contains a peculiarseventeenth-century monumental effigy in wood. The Church of St.Nicholas at West Boldon occupies a lofty site on the side of a hill, andis visible for many miles over Jarrow and the low land round Hedworth.The oldest portions date from the beginning of the thirteenth century.In January, 1906, the nave and chancel roofs were destroyed by fire, andseveral of the monumental inscriptions badly scorched. The Church of St.Hilda, at South Shields, occupies a site of great antiquity, but wasentirely rebuilt in 1810.The Church of St. Mary, Gateshead, is of more general interest, but hasbeen greatly restored. The tower was rebuilt in 1740. The roof of thenave is good, and of Perpendicular date. Several pre-Reformationgrave-covers are built into the walls, two of special interest being inthe porch. A number of quaint extracts from the parish books are givenby Surtees:     1632. Paid for whipping black Barborie 6d.     1649. Paid at Mris Watsons, when the Justices sate to examin the     witches ¾; for a grave for a witch 6d; for trying the witches £1.     5. 0.     1671. Paid for powder and match when the Keelemen mutinyed 2/-.     1684. For carrying 26 Quakers to Durham £2. 17s.In the north-west of the county, Ryton Church (Holy Cross), dates fromthe thirteenth century, and is all of one period. It consists of achancel, nave with north and south aisles, western tower with spire, andsouth porch. In the chancel is a square-headed piscina in the usualposition, a priest’s doorway, and a low side-window, now built up. Inthe north wall is an ambry. The arcades of the nave are of three archeseach, the easternmost pillars on each side being octagonal, the otherscylindrical. The corbel-table of the tower is of interest, several ofthe corbels being carved in foliage designs. The wooden, lead-coveredspire is contemporary with the tower. Within the altar-rails is a finesepulchral effigy in marble of a deacon.Returning again to the central districts, the Church of St. Mary and St.Cuthbert at Chester-le-Street is the successor of an early woodenedifice, which sheltered for the greater part of two centuries theremains of the latter saint, before the Danish invasion of 995 causedhis guardians--for better security--to remove their charge to Ripon.Egelric, fourth Bishop of Durham, decided to rebuild the church ofstone, but it is doubtful if any remains of his church are incorporatedin the present building. The date of the erection of the latter isuncertain.The oldest portions of the present church are the north and south wallsof the chancel, and in the south wall are inserted three windows, datingfrom the thirteenth century, and evidently contemporary with the threeeastern bays of the arcade of the nave. The remaining bays of the naveand the tower are later additions, and the graceful spire still later,dating from the Early Decorated period.At the time of the Reformation there were two chantries in the church,one being in the south aisle, at the east end of which there is atrefoil-headed piscina and square ambry. At the west end of the northaisle, partly within and partly without the church, is an interestingtwo-storied erection, containing four chambers, which must have, at onetime, been an anchorage. The church is chiefly remarkable for the seriesof fourteen monumental effigies of presumed members of the Lumleyfamily. Eleven, however, were the work of sculptors employed by John,Lord Lumley, at the end of the sixteenth century, and two were removedby him from the graveyard of Durham Abbey, under the mistaken impressionthat they represented two of his ancestors.     \"The first effigy, evidently imaginary, represents Liulph in a coat     of mail.... Above this venerable personage is a long inscription     commemorating the whole family descent.     \"Next to Liulph lies Uchtred, in a suit of chain armour....     \"The third effigy, William, son of Uchtred, who first assumed the     Lumley name, is probably genuine. He appears in a full suit of     chain armour, over which is a surcoat, with the drapery hanging in     easy folds below the girdle. The legs are crossed, and rest on a     lion. A shield on the left arm. The head rests on a cushion.     \"The second William de Lumley appears in plate of a much less     genuine description....     \"And the third William is like unto him, save that his legs be     straight and his hair wantonly crisped.     \"And Roger is like William, but sore mutilated.     \"Robert de Lumley, extremely like Roger....     \"Sir Marmaduke Lumley, in mail....     \"Ralph, first Baron Lumley ... one of those removed from the     cemetery of the Cathedral Church of Durham, a close coat of mail,     the visor ribbed down the front with two transverse slits for the     sight, the breast covered with the shield, the sword unsheathed and     upright, the point resting against the visor, the legs straight,     resting on a couchant hound.     \"Sir John Lumley, almost minutely resembling the last.     \"George Lord Lumley. An effigy, recumbent like his predecessors....     The dress is probably intended for the robes of the baron.     \" ... Sir Thomas Lumley, Knight. The figure is in mail....     \"Richard, Lord Lumley....     \"The last effigy, John, Lord Lumley, in robes....\"--SURTEES.In the church is also a thirteenth-century effigy of a bishop,representing St. Cuthbert.St. Mary the Virgin, Lanchester, is a very interesting church, and hasportions of Norman date. It consists of a chancel, nave with north andsouth aisles, and south porch, western tower, and a vestry. The chanceldates from the thirteenth century, and there is a very fine piscina inits south wall. The chancel arch dates from the middle of the twelfthcentury. The vestry opens from the chancel by a very fine doorway, witha cinquefoil arch. The arcades of the nave have four bays on eitherside, with cylindrical pillars and pointed arches. The south aisle andporch date from the beginning, and the north aisle from the end, of thefourteenth century.There is a brass in the chancel to the memory of John Rudd, and aneffigy of a priest lies in a recess in the south aisle. During theepiscopacy of Bishop Bek the church was made collegiate with a Dean andseven Prebendaries, and portions of the woodwork of their stalls arestill preserved.The church at Brancepeth (St. Brandon) has parts dating from thethirteenth century, and is an interesting edifice. The panelling andgeneral internal fittings of the church are of a most elaborate nature.Over the chancel arch is some remarkable screen work, carved in oak andpainted white. The chancel screen and stalls date from the time of JohnCosin, who was rector of Brancepeth before being raised to the Bishopricin 1661, but have the appearance, in common with much of his work atDurham Castle, of belonging to a much earlier period.There are several sepulchral effigies to members of the Neville familyin the church.St. Michael’s, Bishop Middleham, is a thirteenth-century church and allof one period. Whitworth church was entirely rebuilt in 1850, and isonly interesting for the remarkable male and female sepulchral effigiesin the churchyard.At Bishop Auckland, St. Helen’s has a chancel arch and two bays of thearcades of the nave of Late Transitional work, a very short periodseparating them from the western bays of the nave. The chancel is ofthirteenth-century date, and the aisles are prolonged to engage thegreater part of it, forming chantry chapels. The clerestory has threetwo-light, Late Perpendicular windows on each side, and at the west endis a round-headed window of earlier date, but evidently an insertion inits present position. The east window consists of three lancets underone arch, the spandrel spaces being pierced. The south doorway is ofPerpendicular date, and the porch, a later addition, has in common withSt. Andrew’s, Auckland, a chamber above. There is a brass offifteenth-century date in the church.The Church of St. Andrew’s, Auckland, is a fitting edifice to close thisbrief account of the parish churches of Durham. Its site has from theearliest times of Christianity in the North been occupied by a church,and there is strong evidence that it was the home of a collegiate bodyformed of monks removed from Durham by Bishop William de St. Carileph.This establishment was reorganized by Bishop Bek in 1292, and greatalterations were made in the fabric of the church at the same time.The church consists of a chancel, north and south transepts, nave withnorth and south aisles, and western tower. It dates from the thirteenthcentury, and there is evidence that it succeeded a building of Normandate, which was itself either an enlargement of, or a successor to, thefirst building.The church has many points of great interest, and perhaps the moststriking features of the interior are the arcades of the nave. These areof five bays each, with richly moulded arches, resting on alternateoctagonal and clustered piers. The north transept was almost entirelyrebuilt during restoration, but the new work is a copy of the old,which, however, did not date from the original church, but was one ofthe alterations of Bishop Bek, before referred to. The east wall of thechancel is also his work. In 1417 a higher stage was added to the tower,and the clerestory of the nave is of still later date.The chancel stalls are the work of Cardinal Langley and very effective.There are two monumental effigies in the church, one of a Knight inarmour, the other of a lady; both apparently date from the end of thefourteenth century. There are also three brasses.MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS OF THE COUNTY OF DURHAMBY EDWIN DODDSThe earliest-known burial-place in the county of Durham has nomonumental inscriptions in it. It is a barrow opened at Copt Hill, nearHoughton-le-Spring, which contained Neolithic remains, and it isinteresting inasmuch as it has also vestiges of burials made again afterthe lapse of many years, when the Bronze Age had superseded the periodin which men warred and worked with weapons of stone only. There is nomemento known of the Paleolithic Age in the county, and only thirteenplaces of burial used by Neolithic man have been investigated. Of theBronze Age about a dozen burial-places have been examined, many of themcontaining those small rudely fashioned earthenware vessels, from threeto six inches high, roughly ornamented with simple lines and dots, whichare known as \"food-vessels\" and \"incense-cups.\"Of the monumental inscriptions left by the Romans, two of the mostinteresting were found near the Roman station in South Shields. One ofthem is an elaborately carved slab, four feet long, which bears thefigure of a woman seated, with a work-basket at her left hand and ajewel-case at her right; she seems to be occupied in needlework. Belowis the Latin inscription: \"To the Divine Shades of Regina, of theCatuallaunian Tribe, a freed woman, and the wife of Barates thePalmyrene. She lived thirty years.\" Below this is a line in Syriac:\"Regina, the freed woman of Barate. Alas!\" The district of Catuallaunais said to have extended from Gloucestershire to Lincolnshire. It isstrange that affinity of souls should have brought together as man andwife a merchant from Syria and a slave from the centre of England.Another Roman gravestone from South Shields, found in 1885, reads: \"Tothe Divine Shades of Victor. He was by nation a Moor: he lived twentyyears: and was the freed man of Numerianus, a horseman of the first alaof Asturians, who most affectionately followed [his former servant tothe grave].\" This stone probably dates from about A.D. 275; it bears thehalf-recumbent figure of a man on a couch, with a canopy above and theinscription below. At Binchester, near Bishop Auckland--the Vinovia ofthe Romans--a plain slab with ansated ends was found inscribed: \"Sacredto the Divine Shades. Nemesius Montanus the Decurion lived forty years.Nemesius Sanctus, his brother, and his coheirs, erected this inaccordance with the provisions of his will.\" This slab was also probablycarved and set up in the third century. In Roman epitaphs no mention ofdeath is ever made; it is stated that the person commemorated had livedso many years, but the fact that he died and the date of his death isnot recorded.Of Anglo-Saxon memorial crosses there are a large number in the countyof Durham, all of them of great interest, and some of beautifulworkmanship. The most notable are those at Aycliffe, Billingham,Chester-le-Street, Coniscliffe, Darlington, Dinsdale, Durham (where, inthe Dean and Chapter Library, there is a fine collection both oforiginal stones from several places and of facsimile copies), Elwick,Escomb, Gainford, Great Stainton, Haughton-le-Skerne, Hurworth, Kelloe,Norton, Sockburn, and Winston-on-the-Tees. None of them are perfect;most of them are fragments of monuments which have at some time beenbroken up and used as building stones.[Illustration: ANGLO-SAXON STONE AT CHESTER-LE-STREET.]The cross at Kelloe is made up of pieces now carefully joined together;it is a very fine example. Most of these crosses have the characteristicknot-work ornament, and many of them have human figures, crucifixions,monsters, warriors, animals, and birds, carved upon them, the sculptureand design being of the Anglian school. Very few of them have anylettering. One at Chester-le-Street has EADMUND in mixed Runic and Romanletters, but this may be an addition by a later hand. The hog-backedstones of this period, of which some very fine specimens were discoveredat Sockburn in 1900, bear similar knot-work ornaments. In 1833 aburial-place at Hartlepool, and in 1834 one at Monkwearmouth, werediscovered; they both yielded memorial stones, small in size, but ofgreat interest. A stone from the latter place, now in the BritishMuseum, bears the name TIDFIRTH in Runic characters. Tidfirth was thelast Bishop of Hexham, and was deposed about the year 821. The stonesfound at Hartlepool are known as pillow-stones; they are almost square,and only from 9 to 12 inches across by about 2 inches thick. Only sevenof them have been saved. They all bear a cross, sunk in some stones andraised on others, and several of them have short inscriptions in Saxonminuscules. One reads: \"ORATE PRO EDILUINI ORATE PRO UERMUND ETTORTHSUID.\"Those effigies, or early statues, generally recumbent, and madesometimes of wood, but more often of stone, which were placed inchurches from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries, are to be found inmany places in the county, sometimes decently and carefully preserved inthe church, sometimes left to weather and decay in the churchyard, or inthe rectory garden. Among the more noticeable of them are the following:At the west end of Staindrop Church is the \"altar-tomb of alabaster,\"with an effigy of Ralph Neville, first Earl of Westmorland, in platearmour, and with figures of his two wives, one on either hand. Surtees,in his _History of Durham_, describes it as \"this noble tomb, which isin the purest style of the best age of sepulchral monuments.\" Its dateis probably about 1425. There is in the same church another tomb witheffigies, in wood, of the fifth Earl of Westmorland and his two wives;it is dated 1560.Barnard Castle Church has an effigy of a priest attired in chasuble,stole, dalmatic, alb, and amice. The inscription is in Lombardiclettering, and reads: \"ORATE PRO AIA ROBERTI DE MORTHAM QNDM VICARII DEGAYNFORD.\" This Robert de Mortham founded a chantry at Barnard Castle in1339.At Bishopwearmouth there was formerly the effigy of Thomas Middleton ofChillingham, the founder of the family of Silksworth. It representedMiddleton in complete armour, with his hands raised. It bore theinscription: \"Hic jacet Thom’ Middylton Armiger -- -- -- MCCC.\" At one timethis statue lay on an altar-tomb in the north aisle of the church; laterit was placed upright against the wall of the aisle; later, again, it isrecorded that it lay, broken into two pieces, in the porch; to-day itcannot be found.In the Church of St. Giles, in the city of Durham, there is a woodeneffigy in complete armour, which is supposed to represent the firstJohn Heath, of Kepier, who was buried in the chancel of that church in1590.The Lumley monuments are a collection of fourteen effigies which lie inthe north aisle of Chester-le-Street Church. They were placed there by aLord Lumley about 1594. They represent the Lords of Lumley from Liulph,who lived in the days of William the Conqueror, down to the John, LordLumley, who fought at Flodden Field in 1513. Probably only three of thefourteen monuments are genuine; the others were either manufactured or,more probably, collected from other places.The old chapel at Greatham was pulled down in 1788. In a recess in thesouth wall of the transept there was a wooden effigy of an ecclesiastic.During the rebuilding of the chapel a stone coffin containing his bonesand a chalice of pewter was found near the foot of the wall.In the Pespoole seats in the south aisle of Easington Church there is anelegant recumbent figure of a woman, carved in Stanhope marble. On itare carved the three popinjays which were carried on the coat of arms ofthe ancient owners of Horden. At Heighington Church there are two femaleeffigies, one of which has been very fine, but they are both muchweathered and decayed; they are probably of fourteenth-century date. Inthe same church there is a medieval pulpit, the only one remaining inthe county. It is of oak, and on it there is inscribed in black letter:\"<f>orate p’ aiabz Alexandri flessehar et agnetis uxoris sue</f>.\" Tocommemorate oneself by giving a pulpit to the church seems a practicaland useful form of memorial. As this is the only medieval pulpit thecounty has left, it seems likely that its preservation is due to theinscription it bears.When Neasham Abbey, in the north of Yorkshire, fell into ruin, two ofits effigies were moved over the Tees to the church at Hurworth. One ofthem was a remarkably fine figure of a knight in armour, his headcovered with a coat of mail, his body clad in a shirt of mail, overwhich there is a surcoat. His shield has \"barry of eight, threechaplets of roses.\" The armour is of the style in use in the early partof the fourteenth century, and the effigy probably represents the RobertFitzWilliam who was Warden of the Marches in the time of the just KingEdward I., and who died in 1316.In Lanchester Church, under an arch in the wall of the south aisle, liesa recumbent effigy of a canon secular, his raised hands clasping achalice. This is believed to represent Stephen Austell, Dean ofLanchester, who died in 1464. In Monkwearmouth Church, under a canopywhich bears the shields of the Hiltons and Viponds, there is a veryinteresting effigy of a knight in plate armour of the early part of thefifteenth century. This is probably the Baron William Hilton, who builtHilton Castle on the Wear, with its wonderful armorial front. He died in1435. At Norton, near Stockton, there is a magnificent effigy of aknight in chain armour; over the head there is a rich canopy oftabernacle-work; the hands are raised and the legs are crossed, the feetresting on a lion. It is sometimes assumed that this representation of aknight with his legs crossed one over the other indicates that theperson portrayed was a Crusader, but there are many cases where theattitude is used in which it is known that the effigy was that of onewho could not have taken any part in those Holy Wars. This monument isfurther noticeable as it is one of the very few which give us even aslight hint as to the personality of the sculptor; it bears what isbelieved to be his mark in the shape of a small squiggle, which lookslike a short length of chain, in front of which is the letter \"I,\" andit is supposed that this punning rebus means that the effigy is thehandiwork of one John Cheyne. It would be very interesting to know whocommissioned Cheyne to carve this monument, for another curious featurein it is that the shield of the knight bears six coats ofarms--Blakeston, Surtees, Bowes, Dalden, Conyers, and Conyers--whichmean that the knight was a Blakeston of Blakeston. But the Blakestonsbore these arms in the sixteenth century, probably not later than theyear 1587, whereas the armour of the effigy is of the time of Edward I.,1272-1307. Boyle suggests that probably the monument is to one of the DeParks, and that a Blakeston took it, scraped off the De Park arms, andput on his own coat. Whatever its vicissitudes may have been, it remainsa noble piece of work.In Redmarshall Church, in the Claxton Porch, there are effigies ofThomas Langton de Wynyard and of Sibil Langton, his wife. They areadmirably carved in a rather soft alabaster, and the delicacy andclearness of detail in the costumes is very remarkable. The lady’s hairis dressed in the extraordinary horns which were fashionable in the daysof Henry V. She wears a long, loose kirtle, with a surcoat and mantle;round her neck is a string of pearls, and round her waist is a jewelledbelt. The knight wears a suit of plate armour, probably of Italian make,the fashion of which suggests that the effigy was carved several yearsafter the death of Thomas de Langton in 1440.Effigies of men who had devoted themselves to a religious life, but whodied before attaining the order of priesthood, are very rare. There isone of a deacon within the altar-rails of Ryton Church, carved in greenmarble from Stanhope.Whitburn Church holds a singular effigy of comparatively late date.Attired in the full stiff dress of the time of William and Mary lies aplump, elderly gentleman. He wears a full periwig, a neckcloth withsquare ends, a coat with large buckramed skirts and wide sleeves, rolledbreeches, and square-toed laced shoes ornamented with immense bows ofribbon. His head rests on a pillow, and his right hand holds a book,which is open at the text, \"I shall not lye here, but rise.\" There is askull between the feet. On the uprights of the tomb the same figure iscarved in bas-relief, kneeling, and on each side of him is a lady inthe dress of the same period. A tablet on the wall states that this is\"the burial-place of Mr. Michael Mathew of Cleadon, and his wife, whohad issue three sons and two daughters, of which only Hannah survives.\"BRASSES.--In many of the older churches of the county there areremaining the stone matrices which formerly held monumental brasses, butin most cases the brasses themselves have disappeared, the sanctity of achurch, and the contiguity of a Table of the Ten Commandments not havingprevailed against the temptation to steal a substance so portable and soreadily saleable as brass.In the floor of the chapel at Greatham Hospital there is a large slab ofstone, 90 by 43 inches in size, with an inscription in brass Lombardicletters round the edge commemorating William de Middleton, a master ofthe Hospital in 1312. On the wall is another inscription, in raisedblack-letter with chasing, asking for prayers for the souls of NicholasHulme, who was master in 1427, of John Kelyng, 1463, and of WilliamEstfelde, who died in 1497.At Sherburn Hospital there is a small brass let into the chancel steps,which reads: \"THOMAS . LEAVER . PREACHER . TO KING EDWARD . THE . SIXTE.HE . DIED . iN . iVLY . i577.\"In the church at St. Andrew’s Auckland there is a finely cut brass withthe figure of a priest, of which the head is, unfortunately, missing.There is no inscription, but the date of it is probably about 1400. Inthe same church there is a unique brass, small in size, but about ½ inchthick; it bears a small Greek cross with a backing of plant decoration,and it has three lines of inscription across the plate and a legendround the margin. It is dated April 8, 1581, and was put up to thememory of Mrs. Fridesmond Barnes, who was the wife of the secondProtestant Bishop of Durham, Richard Barnes. We know the cost of thisbrass, for in the Bishop’s accounts there is the entry, \"To thegould-smyth at Yorke for a plate to sett over Mrs. Barnes, 32ˢ.\"At St. Helen’s Auckland there is a brass which portrays the figure of aman in a long tunic edged with fur; his wife lies by his side, and beloware figures of his sons and daughters. The inscription is lost, but thedate of it is probably about 1460.In Sedgefield Church there is a curious brass giving the crest ofWilliam Hoton, 1445, with a black-letter inscription below: \"<f>Hic iacetwill[=m]s Hoton . qui . obijt . xviº die Septebr’ Anno . dni . Mill[=m]o .ECCCº . xlvº . cui’ aie ppicietur de’ ame’</f>.\" In the same church there aretwo of the objectionable brasses which were not uncommon in thefifteenth century, which portrayed skeletons in shrouds.Chester-le-Street Church has a very pleasing brass, giving thefull-length figure of a woman attired in the costume of the first halfof the fifteenth century. The lines of the composition are simple andbold, and the effect is very graceful. The brass has no inscription, butit is known that it was put up to the memory of Alice Salcock of Salcockin Yorkshire, who married William Lambton, and who died in 1434.At Dinsdale, on the southern margin of the county, close to the RiverTees, there is in the church a late, small, but beautifully workedbrass, only about 11 inches by 8 inches in size. It bears the coat ofarms of eight quarterings, and records the merciful benefactions to thepoor of the parish of Dinsdale of Mary, the wife of Thomas Spennithorne.She died in 1668, and was buried at Spennithorne.In the magnificent cathedral of Durham most of the sepulchral monumentswere destroyed either at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the reignof Henry VIII., or when the cathedral church was used as a prison forScotch prisoners of war after the Battle of Dunbar in 1650. In 1671Davies wrote his book on _The Rites and Monuments of the Church ofDurham_, with the motto _Tempora mutantur_--on the title-page, giving asad description of the past glories of the church. \"Lodovic de belloMonte, Bishop of Durham,\" he says, \"lieth buried before the high Altarin the Quire, under a most curious and sumptuous Marble stone, which heprepar’d for himself, before he died, being adorned with most excellentworkmanship of Brass, wherein he was most excellently and livelyPictur’d, as he was accustomed to sing, or say Mass.\" This Bishop debello Monte, or Beaumont, died at Brantingham, near Hull, in 1333. Hisgravestone, which was said to be the largest in England, still liesbefore the high-altar in Durham Cathedral, but the \"most excellentworkmanship of Brass\" has utterly disappeared.In Hartlepool Church there is a brass with the figure of a lady in alarge hat, with ruff and farthingale; on another brass below it is theinscription:    HERE VNDER THiS STONE LYETH BVRiED THE BODiE OF THE    VERTVOUS GENTELLWOMAN IANE BELL, WHO DEPTED THiS LYFE THE    . vi. DAYE OF IANVARIE 1593 BEiNGE THE DOWGHTER OF LAVERANCE    THORNELL OF DARLINGTON GENT & LATE WYFE TO PARSAVAL    BELL, NOWE MAiRE OF THIS TOWEN OF HARTiNPOOELL. MARCHANT         whos vertues if thou wilt beholde           peruse this tabel hanginge bye         which will the same to thee vnfold           by her good lyfe learne thou to die.In Haughton-le-Skerne Church there is a curious figure on a brass,representing a lady, who holds a baby on each arm. She was Dorothy, thewife of Robert Perkinson of Whessey, and she died, with her twin sons,in 1592.At Houghton-le-Spring there is a brass to the memory of Margery, wife ofRichard Bellasis. It pictures the kneeling figure of a woman with hereight sons and three daughters behind her. The Bellasis coat of arms ison the brass: the date is 1587.In Sedgefield Church there is a rudely engraved, early brass, probablycut about the year 1300. It shows a small female figure, kneeling, andit has a coat of arms on both sides of the figure. From the shape ofthe two coats of arms, and from the conventional treatment of thefeatures of the face, which is more carefully executed than the rest ofthe figure, it is believed that this is one of the oldest sepulchralbrasses now remaining in England.The tombstone to Dean Rudde, which lies in the floor of the chancel ofSedgefield Church, still carries its inscribed brass. The stone is avery large one. The black-letter epitaph is so much worn by the tread ofthe feet of many generations that it can only be read with someuncertainty. It seems to run:     <f>Orate p aīa [=m]ri Jo[=h]is Rudde in decretis baccalarii quond[=m]     decani hui’ loci qui obiit xxix die decēbr’ Anno d[=n]i Mº CCCCº     lxxxx cui’ āīē ppiciet de’ amen.</f>This John Rudde gave to the church of Esh the only medieval service-bookbelonging to any church in the diocese of Durham which is now known toexist. It is in the library of the Roman Catholic College of Ushaw, nearDurham.The beautiful memorials to the dead which were known as grave-coverswere used in England and Ireland from the ninth to the sixteenthcentury. Though they are abundant in the county, Durham cannot boast ofthe possession of specimens equal in merit to those found in someother parts of England. At Sedgefield Church there is a finethirteenth-century grave-cover with a double, eight-rayed cross; it hasthe rare feature of a double row of dog-tooth ornament at the head; andit is the only stone known in the county which has the whole surfacecovered with a tracery of foliage. It is, unfortunately, much weathered.Built into the tower of the same church, and only partly visible, isanother richly ornamented cover, dating probably from the middle of thefourteenth century, the foliated ornament being more naturally shown, orless conventionalized, than in earlier examples. It bears a sword and across moline on a small shield.The symbolism used on grave-covers is not well understood. A key is saidto indicate a woman, a sword a man; shears sometimes represent a woman,sometimes a wool-stapler; a chalice or a book, or both, are placed onthe gravestone of a priest or other ecclesiastic. Craftsmen are oftenindicated by some sign of their business, as a square for a mason, ahorseshoe or a hammer for a smith. Sometimes a merchant uses histrade-mark much as an armigerous person uses his coat of arms. Builtinto the south porch of St. Mary’s Church in Gateshead there are twolarge grave-covers bearing incised crosses. One of them, afourteenth-century slab, has at one side of the stem of the cross a key,and at the other side a fish. Most authorities think that the fish isthe mystic symbol of our Saviour, which was so dear to the earlyChristians, and which is frequently found on the gravestones in thecatacombs at Rome; but other antiquaries consider that the stone is tobe more literally interpreted, and that it covered the remains of afish-wife.The earlier grave-covers were stone lids for stone coffins, but afterthe use of stone coffins was discontinued, and wooden coffins weresubstituted, the remains of the dead were often covered by these carvedstone slabs. The larger part of them are uninscribed, but grave-coverswith a few lines cut on them are by no means uncommon. At Gainford thereis a perfect grave-cover of the fourteenth century which bears a chaliceand three floreated crosses, one large and two small. It has beensuggested that these prove this to have been the burial-place of anecclesiastic and two children, for burial in a monk’s frock or in thegrave of a priest was long considered by all classes of people to bedesirable. This stone, though it is of early fourteenth-century period,bears an inscription to Laurence Brockett, Regius Professor of ModernHistory at Cambridge, who died in 1768. His executors seem to havethought that an old gravestone was just as good as a new one.Of quaint sepulchral inscriptions there are many in the county. The onein Monkwearmouth Church to the memory of a Mrs. Lee is on a small marbletablet on the vestry wall. It reads:    HEERE VNDER LYETH Yᴱ BODDYE OF MARY LEE    DAVGHTER TO PETER DELAVALE LATE OF    TINMOVTH GENT SHEE DIED IN CHYLDBED              YE 23 OF MAY 1617        HAPIE IS Yᵀ SOVLE Yᵀ HEERE        ON EARTH DID LIVE A HARMLESS LYFE        & HAPPIE MAYD Yᵀ MADE        SOE CHAST AN HONNEST WIFE.It is strange that a lawyer \"of ability and integrity\" should not beable to make himself a sound will. In Greatham Chapel there is aninscription: \"In memory of Ralph Bradley, Esq. an eminent Councillor atLaw, born in this parish, who bequeathed a large fortune, acquired in agreat measure by his abilities and integrity, to the purchasing of bookscalculated to promote the interests of virtue and religion, and thehappiness of mankind. He died the 28th day of December 1788, in the 72dyear of his age....\" Below, on a copper plate, is: \"By a decree ofEdward Lord Thurlow, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, on the 2ᵈday of August 1791, the charitable intention mentioned above was setaside in favour of the next of kin.\"In Stockton Church we may read that on \"Wednesday the 19th of May 1773was here interred the body of Mrs. Sarah Baker ... aged 59. Do thoureflect in time; death itself is nothing, but prepare to be you know notwhat, to go you know not where.\"At Houghton-le-Spring stands the massy altar-tomb of the great BernardGilpin, \"the apostle of the North,\" that sweet-natured, fearless, andhumble-minded man who so narrowly escaped a martyr’s death at the stake.The tomb bears his coat of arms and the following:BERNERD                                             OBIT QVAGILPIN RE     [A bear with a crescent on its side,  RTV DIE MCTOR HV             leaning against a tree.]        ARTII AN.IVS ECCLIÆ                                          DOM. 1583.

Truth Faith and Justice, and a Loyall Heart      In him Showd Nature, which in most is Art.In the same church of Houghton-le-Spring there is the following epitaph:\"Here Lyes interr’d the Body of Nicolas Conyers Esqʳ. High Sheriff ofthis County Chiefe of yᵉ Family of Conyers of the House of Boulby inYorkshire. He dyed at South Biddick Mar: 27 A.D. 1689 his age 57.\" Belowis his crest.At Houghton Hall Robert Hutton, a zealous Puritan and a Captain inCromwell’s army, was buried in his own orchard, where his altar-tomb isinscribed: \"HIC JACET ROBERTVS HVTTON ARMIGER QVI OBIIT AVG. DIE NONO1681 ET MORIENDO VIVIT.\"In the Galilee Chapel at the west end of Durham Cathedral there is astone on the floor inscribed:    JOHN BRIMLEIS BODY HERE DOTH LY,    WHO PRAY SED GOD WITH HAND AND VOICE;    BY MUSICKES HEAVENLY HARMONIE    DULL MINDS HE MAID IN GOD REJOICE.    HIS SOUL INTO THE HEAVENS IS LYFT    TO PRAISE HIM STILL THAT GAVE THE GYFT.This Brimley was master of the Song School at Durham Cathedral.That mighty builder, Hugh Pudsey, who was Bishop of Durham from 1153 to1195, seems to have had a fellow-worker who pleased him in the person ofChristian the Mason, whose grave-cover is at Pittington. One wonderswhether it was after Christian had built for the Bishop the stoutfortifications of Durham Castle, or whether it was when he had finishedthe beautiful Galilee Chapel of the cathedral, that Pudsey gave him, aswe know he did, forty acres in the moor at South Sherburn, besides otherlands, \"quit of all rent whilst he should remain in the service of thebishop.\" Pudsey’s own tomb in Durham Cathedral is broken and dispoiled,but Christian the Mason’s grave-cover at Pittington can still be read:    ✠NOMEN ABENS CRISTI TVMVLO TVMVLATVR IN ISTO    ✠QVI TVMVLVM CERNIT COMMENDET CVM PRECE CRISTO,which may be interpreted: \"One having the name of Christ is buried here.Let him who beholds the grave commend himself with prayer to Christ.\"In the churchyard of St. Hild’s at Hartlepool, about 6 feet from theeast wall of the modern chancel, there is an old altar-tomb covered witha very large slab of bluish stone. If it has ever been inscribed thelettering is now utterly weathered off, but it has the lion of Bruce onthe uprights at the sides still faintly visible. This is theresting-place of the fathers of Robert Bruce. They owned Hart andHartlepool for many generations before Robert Bruce claimed the crown ofScotland in 1306. His lands in the county of Durham were then seized andgiven to the Cliffords. In Easington Church there is an effigy of a ladyin thirteenth-century costume, which probably represents Isabella, firstwife of John Fitz-Marmaduke. She was the daughter of Robert de Brus ofSkelton, and the sister of Robert Bruce, King of Scotland.Coming last to the ordinary inscriptions on the tombstones andheadstones of our churchyards, one of the first things that strikes anobserver is the large number of cases where, though the stone remains,the inscription is wholly or partly weathered off and lost; such casesare an occasion of woe to the genealogist. In looking through a countrychurchyard it will often be found that 10 per cent. of the stones areunreadable. This is generally because a soft and unsuitable stone hasbeen used. Some slate-stones stand well; limestones and marbles onlylast while they are in a church, rain and slight traces of acid in theatmosphere soon disintegrate them out of doors. Granite will probablyendure very long, but it has been little used in Durham churchyards, andonly since about 1860. Sandstones are most generally used, and some ofthese, of a close-grain and of a dark colour when old, stand exceedinglywell. The fell sandstones, or hassells, used in the west of the county,are almost as hard as granite. They are very difficult to cut, so thelettering on them is often quite shallow; but stones 200 years old arequite unaffected by weather. Soft sandstones, which are easily cut,either crumble and decay gradually, or in some cases they scale off inflakes and perish very quickly. It is common to see two stones of aboutthe same date, standing side by side, one of which is sound and clear,while the other cannot be read. Frequently one finds a stone where,owing to differences of hardness, one part of the inscription is sharpand legible, while other parts are completely gone.Along the parishes on the coast of the county the wanderer cannot failto be struck with the constant repetition of the words, \"Lost at sea,\"and if he should turn to the registers of these parishes and read themany entries like, \"A woman at ye sea side found drowned,\" \"A man castupon our sands by the sea,\" \"Foure Duchmen wth a woman and a childebeing drowned by shipwrack were buried in this Churchyard,\" he willlearn what a heavy tithe the sea takes from the land, and how high isthe price that man pays for the sovereignty of the sea.Punning epitaphs are, fortunately, not numerous in the county. Here isone, from Stockton, to the memory of two masons, \"Ralph Wood, whodeparted this life Oct. 22, 1730, in the 67th year of his age. Herelieth the Body of Ralph Wood, aged 67, 1743.    \"We that have made tombs for others,            Now here we lie;     Once we were two flourishing Woods,            But now we die.\"THE CASTLES AND HALLS OF DURHAMBY HENRY R. LEIGHTONAlthough the county of Durham is not studded with castles and peels likeits northern neighbour, nor decked with many ancient homes in a stillpicturesque and habitable condition, like the moors and valleys of York,it is still fairly rich in buildings of historic and antiquarianinterest.The banks of the Wear alone, if followed from the source to the mouth,may be compared to some miniature Rhine in picturesqueness. Themountainous scenery of Weardale, and the frequent woods and plantationsthat ornament the banks of its lower reaches, the castles of Stanhope,Witton, Auckland, Brancepeth, Durham, Lumley, Lambton, and Hilton,rising in a stately succession, to say nothing of the glorious oldcathedral, the monastic ruins of Finchale, and the grey old tower ofWearmouth, make a panorama unrivalled in its way. It may, however, beremarked in all fairness that almost every English stream can tell asimilar story, and for a vision, in homely and familiar buildings, of aglorious past our England stands unrivalled.The first-named of the above mansions, Stanhope Castle, stands upon thesite of a fortified house existing in the time of Bishop Anthony Bek.The present building is, however, a Georgian structure erected about acentury ago by Cuthbert Rippon, M.P. for Gateshead. The old home of[Illustration: WITTON CASTLE IN 1779.]the Fetherstonhaughs, so long associated with this district, StanhopeHall, is an Elizabethan mansion with several panelled rooms, and is nowdivided amongst a number of tenants.Witton Castle, erected by the great baronial house of Eure, stands onthe south side of the river, not very far from Witton-le-Wear. It waserected somewhere about 1410, for in that year Bishop Langley granted apardon to Sir Ralph Eure for having commenced to embattle hismanor-house at Witton. It originally consisted of a square bailey,surrounded by an outer wall, with a projecting keep on the north side.The keep has been considerably altered at various periods. It is oblongin shape, with corner turrets rising above the roof. The basementconsists of one barrel-vaulted apartment, with adjoining chambers in thenorth-west, south-west, and south-east turrets; the entrances to two ofthese were originally fastened on the outer side. The first floor is thegreat hall, and has doorways leading into chambers in the turrets.Another door in the north-east corner leads to a newel staircaseascending to the battlements. The room immediately over the east end ofthe great hall has a doorway opening into a small mural chamber,originally a latrine, in the north-east turret. This floor has a passagein the thickness of the west wall. The parapets are reached by thestaircase already referred to. The turrets at the north-east andsouth-east corners project like angle buttresses, and the latter has twofigures in armour, similar to those at Hilton Castle, standing on theparapet. The north-west turret is larger, and its sides are parallelwith the walls of the keep. The south-west turret is still larger, andit projects beyond the south front, having its west wall continued inline with that of the main building. All the turrets have crenellatedparapets. The eastern turrets have their alternate sides machicolated ondouble corbels.The outer wall has two gateways, one on the east, and the other on thewest side, leading into the courtyard. Both are defended by machicolatedgalleries above, the parapet being carried outwards on double corbels.The whole wall is defended by a broad battlement with a high parapetround the top. There are embrasures at intervals, each originallydefended by movable shutters; a round socket on one side, and a slot onthe other, remain to show where the pivots moved. A number of roundholes in the walls were intended to support woodwork on which platformscould be erected, thus enabling the garrison to strike at attackersbelow.Each angle of this outer or curtain wall was originally strengthened bya bartizan. Three of these were circular, but one, that at thenorth-west corner, was pulled down in the early days of last century.The fourth bartizan, that at the south-west corner of the wall, isalmost square in shape, with the outer walls projecting and resting oncorbels. It contains a guardroom, with a fireplace, and two doorsopening on to the adjoining battlements. The south-east bartizan alsocontains a room, circular in shape, with a loopholed wall. About acentury ago the castle was unfortunately damaged by fire. It wasafterwards restored by Mr. J. T. H. Hopper, the owner.Tracing the river eastwards, the ancient home and palace of the Bishopsand Lords Palatine stands close to the river and to the east of Aucklandtown.Robert de Graystanes, one of the early chroniclers, states that BishopAnthony Bek erected the manor-house at Auckland, but from severalentries in the Boldon Book it is evident that the Bishops had aresidence there at the time that record was drawn up.The existing buildings are extensive, and are approached from themarket-place through a castellated gateway. One of the most prominentand interesting features is the chapel, which was originally the greathall. It was adapted for its present purpose and consecrated by BishopCosin. Prior to the great Civil War, there were two chapels, variouslyreferred to, and as early as 1338, as the major and the minor. One ofthese was over the other, and they stood to the south of the castleproper, near to a postern which opened on to a road outside the park.When for a while the Episcopal Church was abolished by a PuritanGovernment, and the old story of spiteful spoliation began, AucklandPalace was sold to Sir Arthur Heslerigg for £6,102 8s. 11½d. Thisredoubtable worthy appears to have dismantled a considerable portion ofthe buildings. He blew up the chapels,[11] and commenced to alter theplace to suit his own ideas.It seems probable that Sir Arthur left his projected buildings in anunfinished state, for when Bishop Cosin came to his diocese at theRestoration, he wrote that the castle \"had been pul’d down and ruined.\"The Bishop commenced an extensive restoration, and a number ofinteresting letters and agreements have been preserved showing theprogress made.As it now stands, the chapel is divided into nave and aisles by arcades,each of four bays. The supporting pillars are clearly those described byLeland, who, speaking of the great hall, says: \"There be divers pillarsof black marble speckled with white.\" Each pillar consists of fourclustered cylindrical shafts, two being of Weardale marble, and two offreestone. The four pillars nearest the west are banded half-way up, andthe capitals of the two western pillars are carved with foliage, thenorth-western showing also the spiral scroll or volute. The capitals ofthe other pillars and the bases of all are moulded, the latter restingon square plinths.The arches are richly moulded, and have labels terminating in carvedornaments. They rest at the east end on responds of three clusteredshafts, two of marble, and one of freestone, with moulded capitals andbases. At the west end the arches rest on highly ornamental corbels.Each of the latter consists in its lower portion of two carved heads,the northernmost being of Bishops wearing mitres, and the southern ofcrowned Kings. From within the mitres and crowns rise dwarfed shaftswith Late Transitional foliage carved on the bells. Each capital issurmounted with a square moulded abacus, on which rest the bases of atriplet of dwarfed, clustered shafts corresponding to those in the piersof the arcades. In the spandrels between the arches, on both sides, arecarved corbels; those on the inner side carry single cylindrical shaftssurmounted by moulded capitals, and originally carried the pendant postsof the roof. The outer corbels supported the rafters of the aisle roofs.There is now but little doubt that this portion of the building waserected by Bishop Pudsey.Bishop Hatfield made further improvements, inserting the windows stillexisting. At a much later period, as already mentioned, Bishop Cosinaltered and restored the castle, which he appears to have made hisfavourite residence. He certainly took great delight and pride inimproving his country home. Most of the fine woodwork in the chapel ishis work--the roof, mouldings, and the great screen at the west endbeing particularly noteworthy.Since his time the chapel has been but little altered. Bishop VanMildert refloored it, and Bishop Lightfoot erected a new reredos, andfilled most of the windows with stained glass.The other portions of the castle have been considerably modernized, andbear but little resemblance to Pennant’s picture of it. The room whichhe describes as \"below stairs,\" and having painted on the old wainscot\"the arms of a strange assemblage of potentates, from Queen Elizabeth,with all the European princes, to the Emperors of Abissinia,Bildelgerid, Carthage, and Tartaria, sixteen peers of the same reign,knights of the garter, and above[Illustration: LUMLEY CASTLE.]them the arms of every bishoprick in England,\" is now used as thehousekeeper’s storeroom.The wing containing the servants’ hall (on the ceiling of which is aplaster shield of Bishop Tunstall’s arms) and the dining-room wascommenced by Bishop Ruthall, and completed by the former prelate. Thearms of both Bishops appear on the exterior of the building. Adjoiningthis wing to the west is another of some length, still known by thecurious name of _Scotland_, and undoubtedly erected by Tunstall. No verysatisfactory reason has been offered for the derivation of its name.Brancepeth Castle stands within a mile from the River Wear, a little tothe south of the village of the same name. There was undoubtedly acastle there in the twelfth century, towards the end of which it passed,by the marriage of Emma, widow of Peter de Valoignes, and only child ofBertram de Bulmer, to Geoffrey de Neville, from the former to the latterfamily.The present castle is stated by Leland to have been erected by Ralph,first Earl of Westmorland. It was defended north and east by a moat;south and west the walls rise from a rock nearly forty feet in height.The original gateway, defended by a portcullis and flanked by squaretowers, stood on the site of the present gate, and was approached fromthe north. It has been destroyed. It opened directly into the courtyard,south-west of which are the residential parts of the castle.There were, when Hutchinson wrote, four towers, closely conjoined. Threeof these remain, containing respectively the dining-room, saloon, andthe baron’s hall. The destroyed tower stood north of the last mentioned,but was not so high. It contained three stories, and was probably, asMr. Boyle has suggested, the great hall.The projecting angles of the towers are surmounted by small turrets,eight in number, the arrangement consisting of two sides rising directlyfrom the sides of the buttresses on which they are built, whilst theother two are machicolated, the parapets resting on corbels.Two other towers now standing at either end of the billiard-room arerespectively used as the chapel and the library. The castle possesses anumber of other interesting features.Amongst the pictures is one by Hogarth, painted for the first ViscountBoyne, and representing several members of the _Hell-fire Club_. Theyare supposed to have assembled in a wine-cellar, and resolved not topart until its contents have been consumed. Sir Philip Hoby is depictedsitting on a cask of claret. Immediately behind him, with his hand heldup, is Mr. De Grey, and below him is Lord John Cavendish, who has drawna spigot from the cask to let the wine flow into a bowl. Lord Sandwichis kneeling down, holding a bottle to his mouth. Lord Galway liesextended on a form, in such a position that the liquor from a cask abovehim is flowing into his mouth. The arrangement of the four centralfigures is a clever imitation of a statue of _Charity_ shown in thecellar.There is some fine armour in the present and modern great hall, amongstothers a suit richly inlaid in gold, and traditionally said to have beentaken from the Scottish King after the Battle of Neville’s Cross,although really it is of Elizabethan date.The existing castle in Durham City, long the principal seat of theEpiscopal Princes, largely helps, with its frowning walls and grimbattlements, standing side by side with the cathedral, to make Durhamone of the most picturesque cities in this country.The castle is approached from the north-west corner of the Palace Green,a short avenue leading to the gateway, which was modernized by BishopBarrington. The iron-bound gates were placed there by Bishop Tunstall,and one of them contains a wicket which is the subject of one ofSpearman’s amusing anecdotes. He states that Bishop Crewe had beenpressing Dr. Grey, Rector of Bishopwearmouth, and Dr. Morton, Rector ofBoldon, to read King James’s declaration for a dispensing power in theirparish churches. Both declined and began to argue against it, when theBishop appears to have lost his temper. He told Dr. Grey that his agemade him dote, and that he had forgotten his learning. \"The good oldDoctor briskly replied he had forgott more learning than his Lordshipever had. ‘Well,’ said the Bishop, ‘I’ll forgive and reverence you, butcannot pardon that blockhead Morton, whom I raised from nothing.’ Theythereupon took their leave of the Bishop, who with great civility waitedupon them towards the gate, and ye porter opening ye wikett or posterneonly, ye Bishop said, ‘Sirrah, why don’t you open ye great gates?’ ‘No,’says ye Reverend Dr. Grey, ‘my Lord, wee’le leave _ye broad way_ to yourlordship, _ye strait way_ will serve us.’\"The gateway leads directly into the courtyard. A door and flight ofsteps in the wall to the left leads into the Fellows’ Garden, formerlythe private garden of the Bishops, through which they could enter BishopCosin’s library.Crossing the court to the left, the first building approached is partlyof early Norman date, with additions by Bishop Fox, and a laterrestoration by Bishop Cosin, whose arms, impaling the see, are upon thefront. It is now used entirely as students’ quarters.A portico farther along the court leads into the great hall, erected byBishop Anthony Bek. The hall measures 101 feet long by 35 feet wide, andwas restored somewhere about 1850.The window at the north end was filled with stained glass in 1882 tocommemorate the jubilee of the University.The walls are hung with paintings, and include:1. A collection of thirteen portraits of English Archbishops andBishops, said to have been made by Bishop Cosin.2. Ten pictures of the Apostles, which were taken at St. Mary’s, inSpain, in the expedition under the Duke of Ormond, and purchased by theDean and Chapter in 1753.3. A number of portraits of prebendaries and professors.4. Portraits of Charles I., Bishop Cosin, and Charles II.On the same wall as the last-mentioned portraits the banners of theDurham local volunteer companies, raised to defend the country at thetime of Napoleon’s threatened invasion, are suspended.A door at the north end of the hall leads to Bishop Cosin’s greatstaircase, which is most handsomely carved.At the foot of the staircase a corridor, the woodwork of whichoriginally formed part of the same Bishop’s choir screen in thecathedral, may be entered.The staircase itself, however, leads more directly to Bishop Tunstall’sGallery, and to several apartments, from one of which a door opens uponthe terrace on the north side of the castle.Tunstall’s Gallery contains several objects of interest, and the wallsare covered with sixteenth-century tapestry.Here also is the magnificent Norman doorway erected by Bishop Pudsey asthe entrance to his lower hall. From its position and the weathering ofthe stonework, it is supposed to have originally been approached by astairway from the court; the case at the top must have been roofed withopen arcades at the sides.The present Senate-room of the University contains some good tapestry,illustrating the life of Moses, and dating from the sixteenth century.This room also contains a handsome carved fireplace, armoriallydecorated, and evidently the work of Bishop James. In the centre are theRoyal Arms, Garter, and Motto. On either side are the arms of thePalatinate impaling the Bishop’s dolphin and cross-crosslets, with theJames’s motto, \"Dei Gratia Sum quod Sum.\"[Illustration: HILTON CASTLE WEST FRONT.]The adjoining anteroom contains several paintings, including portraitsof King James II. and his Queen, Mary of Modena.Leaving the county town behind, the picturesque outlines of LumleyCastle may be seen for some miles from the train journeying toNewcastle. It is situated about a mile from Chester-le-Street, but onthe opposite bank of the Wear. The place is first mentioned by Styr, theson of Ulf, in a list of gifts made to St. Cuthbert.The castle is supposed to have been erected by Sir Ralph Lumley, whoobtained licences from Richard II. and Bishop Skirlaw to embattle hishouse of Lumley. It is in arrangement a square courtyard, surrounded bya quadrangle. Two of the fronts, the south and north, measure 65 yards 1foot in length, the other two 58 yards and 1 foot. Oblong towers, ofgreater height than the main portions of each front, from which theyproject, strengthen and guard each corner. The most exterior angle ofeach tower is capped by a buttress.The west front is the oldest existing portion of the castle, and issupposed to have been the Lumley manor-house, before Sir Ralph extendedand added to it.Originally the east side of it, that looking into the courtyard, was theprincipal front, and in its centre the gateway, flanked bysemi-octagonal turrets, may still be seen. The front of the gateway isformed of two arches, the outer segmental headed, and the inner onepointed. Between these is the groove wherein the portcullis ran. Thearch leads to a vaulted passage which entered the original courtyard. Onthe north side of the passage is a pointed doorway, leading into anarrow corridor, having a latrine at its east end, and connectedoriginally with the gatekeeper’s room.The present gateway is in the centre of the east front, and hasincorporated with it an earlier round-headed archway, withsemi-octagonal jambs and moulded imposts. On either side of it is asquare turret, surmounted by octagonal machicolated parapets, thealternate sides of which are embrasured.The turrets are joined by a machicolated gallery, defended by abattlemented parapet. Above the door are six sculptured coats of arms.Between the two highest, Neville and Percy, is the royal coat of RichardII. Below is the Lumley coat, having on the sinister side the arms ofGrey, and on the dexter the coat of Hilton. The shields are allsurmounted by the respective family crests.A room on the south side of the gateway contains in its centre a flag,which on being raised leaves open the entrance to a vaulted chamberabout 10 feet square and some 16 feet deep. From the existence of alatrine, and a little ventilation from a small unglazed loophole lookinginto the courtyard, it seems to have been intended as a safe place forthe custody of prisoners.In the north-east tower are two rooms, divided by a modern partition,and showing evidence that they originally formed the private chapel ofthe family. The south-east tower contains on its second floor the statebedroom, in which King James I. is said to have slept when he visitedLumley.In the north-west tower is the famous kitchen, which Howitt described as\"one of the most stupendous, lofty, and every way remarkable kitchens inthe kingdom.\" The south-west tower contains the banqueting-hall,celebrated for its very fine stuccoed ceiling, part of the workinitiated by Richard, second Earl of Scarborough.Between the towers on the west side the main building forms the baron’s,or great, hall, which probably remained unaltered from the time of SirRalph to the early days of the century before last. The fireplace is thework of John, Lord Lumley, and is decorated with the family arms,impaling FitzAlan. Here also is a large equestrian statue, representingLiulph, a traditional ancestor of the house. There are also a series ofinteresting family portraits.Not far from Lumley, Lambton Castle stands on the northern and oppositebank of the river. The original home of the Lambton family was, however,on the same bank as Lumley. According to an old view, it was a doublehouse of stone, with flanking, gabled wings, and the grounds laid out inparterres and terraces. It remained the residence of the family, untilit was dismantled in 1797 by William Henry Lambton, who had adoptedHarraton Hall as the family seat.[12]The present Lambton Castle[13] stands on the site and incorporatesportions of the original building of Harraton Hall, a manor-houseerected about the year 1600. Very considerable additions were made tothis hall by William Henry Lambton, grandfather of the late Lord Durham,from designs by the elder Bonomi, in the Italian style. The first LordDurham also made considerable alterations and additions to the buildingfrom plans furnished by Bonomi, the general appearance of the mansionbeing entirely changed. The south front is in the Tudor style andcastellated, and the north is Norman.The great hall is panelled, and the windows are glazed with richlystained glass, containing a representation of \"Ye Legend of the Worme ofLambton,\" and also the heraldic emblems of the family. The dimensions ofthe hall are 94 feet by 36 feet, being larger than St. Stephen’s Hall,Westminster. The principal staircase leading out of the hall,communicating with the upper apartments, is 24 feet wide and 36 feethigh. East of the hall is the dining-room and west is the drawing-room,abutting on the terraces of the west lawn.Owing to the subsidence of the hill on which the castle stands, throughsome old colliery workings underneath falling in, the castle had become,when the second Earl succeeded to the estates, insecure. To meet this,and strengthen the foundations, the workings, two seams deep, round thecastle, to the extent of 4½ acres, were filled up with débris. Threeseams lower still were bricked up, over 10,000,000 bricks being used,and in several instances in the fourth seam the brickwork exceeded 30feet in height.Hilton Castle, like Lambton, stands on the north bank of the River Wear,on a gentle slope commanding an extensive view of the valley to thewest.The present building, a melancholy-looking tower, is only the gatehouseof the original castle. It is first mentioned in the inquisitionpost-mortem of William de Hilton in 1435, when it is described as \"ahouse constructed of stone, called the Yethouse.\" The intention of theoriginal builder, the William just mentioned, was evidently to erect anextensive mansion on a similar scale, but there is sufficient evidenceto show that he never completed the work.That there were other buildings probably surrounding a courtyard isproved by various inventories. In 1559, after the death of Sir ThomasHilton, an inventory of his effects mentions the great chamber, thegreen chamber, the middle and new chambers, the gallery, the wardrobe,the parlour, the chamber over the hall door, and various out-buildings,such as the brewhouse, buttery, and the barns. The tower is mentionedseparately, and the term evidently applies to the existing building.These surrounding buildings were probably removed by John Hilton, whoearly in the eighteenth century built[Illustration: OLD TOWER AT RAVENSWORTH CASTLE.]a large wing in the Italian style against the north end of thegatehouse. This erection was three stories in height, having pedimentedwindows in the two lower floors, and square-headed windows in the storyabove. John Hilton also, to some extent, spoiled the ancient gatehouseby inserting a number of similar pedimented windows in it. His son, thelast of the male line to own Hilton, and also named John, added asimilar south wing. Both these wings were castellated--at any rate, onthe east front.The castle passed by descent to the Musgraves, and afterwards bysuccessive sales to the Bowes and Briggs families, and again within thelast year or two to the Monkwearmouth Colliery Company.As it now stands, the tower presents a bold and picturesque outline. Itis divided, on the west front, into three bays by projecting,square-shaped turrets. The main entrance is through the central bay,over which is a fine array of heraldry. Immediately beneath the arcade,the elaborately carved and projecting canopies of which fell in 1882, isa banner and staff of the Royal Arms of France and England _temp._ HenryV. Beneath the banner are the arms of Neville, Vesci, and Percy, andamongst other coats represented are those of the families of Lumley,Grey, Eure, Washington, Felton, Heron, Surtees, and Bowes. On theright-hand turret, close to the entrance, beneath a canopy, is a largebanner of the Hilton arms. The east front shows a curious sculpture ofthe family badge, _a roebuck collared and chained_. Below is the familycoat, accompanied with their curious crest--_the head of Moses, hornedwith triple rays_.The battlements are exceedingly picturesque and decorated with numerousstatued figures, one of which apparently represents the slayer of theLambton Worm.The ancient family chapel stands in a semi-ruinous condition a little tothe north of the castle.Ravensworth Castle was erected towards the end of the thirteenthcentury, and has belonged successively to the Fitz-Marmadukes, Lumleys,Boyntons, Gascoignes, and Liddells. It originally consisted of fourtowers, one standing at each angle of a courtyard and joined by curtainwalls. Two of these towers still stand and form part of the presentcastle, which was erected shortly after 1808, from designs by Nash. Itmay be added that the castle was formerly known as Ravenshelm,Ravensworth being the name of the adjoining village. Not far from thecastle, and near to the road leading to the north entrance, is an oldcross commonly known as the \"Butter Cross.\" It is stated that thecountry people left their produce here for the citizens of Newcastle totake when that city was infested by the plague in the sixteenth century.[Illustration: THE CROSS AT RAVENSWORTH.]A few miles to the west, Gibside, a seat of the Earl of Strathmore,stands in an exceedingly picturesque position. A terrace at the back ofthe house stands above a sheer descent to an exceedingly wild glen. Theolder portions of the building were erected by Sir William Blakiston,who had inherited the estate from his grandmother, an heiress of theMarley family, in the reign of James I. Over the entrance are the RoyalArms, and the arms of Blakiston and Marley quarterly with the initialsW. I. B. for Sir William and his wife Jane Lambton. There is also aninteresting sundial inscribed with the motto _Ut hora, sic vita_. Theold drawing-room has a large fireplace, with figures of Samson andHercules at either side, and above a further heraldic display of thefamily alliances.There are four baronial mansions lying between the Wear and the Tees.Barnard Castle, once a residence of the princely house of Baliol, hasfor long years been a ruin.Originally erected by Bernard de Baliol, son of Guy de Baliol, Lord ofBailleul en Vimeu in Picardy, and founder also of Baynard’s Castle inLondon, it passed on the attainder of his descendant John Baliol,sometime King of Scotland, in 1296 to Bishop Bek. A few years laterEdward I. severed the Durham fees of Bruce and Baliol from the controlof the Palatinate and granted Barnard Castle to the Beauchamps. Bymarriage the estate passed to the Nevilles, and by marriage again to theCrown. Later it passed to the Vanes, who hold it still. The castle,which was of some size and great strength, stands in a commandingposition above the River Tees. A great portion of the remainingbuildings dates from Norman times. One of the towers is still known asthe Brackenbury Tower, evidently deriving its name from the family ofthe famous Constable of the Tower of London. The castle is alsoassociated with Richard III., whose badge of \"the hog\" occurs in one ofthe rooms.Not far from Barnard, Streatlam Castle stands in a valley between thattown and Raby. It has remained the property of the descendants of theowners in the twelfth century to this day, although it has passed bymarriage successively to the Traynes, Boweses, and Lyons. The existingcastle includes some portions of the structure erected by old SirWilliam Bowes. This Sir William is stated on the death of his young wifeJane, daughter of Lord Greystock, under the age of twenty, to have goneto the wars in France, where for some years he was Chamberlain to theRegent, the Duke of Bedford. Sometime about 1450 he pulled down theolder castle at Streatlam, and erected a new one from designs he hadbrought from France. His arms are on the north front of the castle,which has been altered frequently since his time. A good portion of itwas pulled down by William Blakiston Bowes, who died in 1721, leavinghis alterations incomplete.Raby Castle, one of the finest baronial piles in the North of England,and for many centuries the great seat of the princely house of Neville,would require, to deal with it in justice, more pages than a volume oflimited space can afford. A few of its leading features must, however,be mentioned. Portions of the present building were erected by Ralph,Lord Neville, one of the commanders at Neville’s Cross, who died in1367. His son John carried on the work, and in 1378 obtained a licencefrom Bishop Hatfield to embattle and crenellate his manor-house at Raby.In aspect the castle consists of buildings forming a rough square, withtowers projecting from three of the corners, the whole enclosing acourtyard. The four outer sides face the cardinal points. Some distancefrom the main building, a wall 30 feet high with a deep moat on itsouter side entirely enclosed it. The main entrance is guarded by a largetower thrown forward in a flanking position, rendering the approachexceedingly difficult to an opposing force. This building is known asClifford’s Tower. At the south end of a curtain wall running southwardsstands the Watch Tower, which has, however, been considerablymodernized. Adjoining the great gatehouse,[Illustration: STREATLAM CASTLE.]which is the work of at least two builders, is the tower which Lelandsays bears the name of Joan, wife of the first Earl of Westmorland. Eastof Joan’s Tower is another stretch of curtain wall now containing thedrawing-rooms, and terminating at Bulmer’s Tower, an interestingbuilding in shape an irregular pentagon. On the upper story of thistower is the badge of the builder, a large Old English <f>b</f>, doubtless likethe bull, their other badge, derived from the Bulmers.A block of modern buildings adjoining the Bulmer Tower adjoins a tower,from which a corridor enters the great hall, 90 feet long and 35 feetwide. Close to the hall is the kitchen, which has been preserved in allits original quaintness. Over a passage leading from the east side ofthe great hall is the chapel. A short curtain wall connects this portionof the building with the Mount Raskelf Tower, evidently named after amanor owned by the Nevilles in Yorkshire. It is rather curious toobserve that the Christian names Ralph and Henry, which occur sofrequently in old northern families, are the predominating namesrespectively of the great houses of Neville and Percy.Walworth Castle, a large, picturesque old house, was erected by theJenisons in or about the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The north front,flanked by two projecting wings, has a centre three stories highterminating in a balustraded parapet. The south front has a circulartower at each end. The windows were originally decorated with fine oldpainted glass of heraldic design, which has been almost entirelydestroyed in modern times. Some fragments have, however, been gatheredtogether and are preserved in a window in the corridor. Here King JamesI. was entertained and slept on his progress to the South in 1603.Inferior to the larger houses, there were in the county severalbuildings of great strength coming under the same head as the_peel-houses_ or _towers_ on the borders.One of these, now only represented by a few portions of the outer walls,was Dalden Tower. The buildings appear to have formed a tower ratherlonger than square, standing on a slight mound. The walls were ofrubble, 5 feet thick. In the east wall there is a square-headed niche,surmounted by a pediment within an ogee-headed arch, the space withinwhich is filled with tracery. Two blank shields are upon a cornice overthe pediment. The niche seems to point to the room once adjoining havingbeen the private chapel. On the inner side of the curtain facing thewest wall there appears to have been a cell with a loophole.A more recent manor-house was built about the reign of James I.,adjoining the tower on the east, and portions of it are built into thepresent farmhouse. For some generations it was a seat of the Royalistfamily of Collingwood, and, at an earlier date, of a branch of the greathouse of Bowes. It was a lady of this family, Maud, wife of Sir WilliamBowes and heiress of Sir Robert Dalden, who possessed within the oldwalls a curious library. In her will, made in 1420, she left to MatildaHilton _one Romaunce-boke_, to Dame Eleanor Washington _the boke withthe knotts_, to Elizabeth de Whitchester a book that is called_Trystram_, and to her god-daughter Maud, daughter of the Baron ofHilton, _one Romaunce boke is called the Gospells_. Surtees pertinentlywrites: \"Did a romance ever actually exist under this strange title? orhad the lady of Dalden met with one of Wicliffe’s Bibles, and conceivedthe Gospels to be a series of fabulous adventures, in which our Saviourand His Apostles were introduced to act and to moralize like the goodlypersonages who figure in the ancient mysteries, or in _Les Jeux du RoiRené d’Anjou_\"?Farther to the south an old tower, oblong in shape stood at Little Eden.It was, however, taken down in the early days of last century by Mr.Rowland Burdon, who erected the present castellated house at CastleEden. At Dinsdale, on the banks of the Tees, the remains of the ancienthome of the Surtees family were excavated by the late Mr. Scott Surtees,and showed that a large gatehouse of late twelfth-century work, withvaulted chambers and a newel stair, had once stood there.The later manor-house of the Place family retains some portions of theolder building. With thick walls and low rooms with heavy beams andrafters, and an old oak staircase with a wicket, it still remains apicturesque fragment of former days. A stone originally fixed over agateway destroyed shortly before Hutchinson compiled his history is nowlet into the wall on the left of the farmhouse door, and bears the armsof Place quarterly with Surtees.The home of the Surtees’s neighbours, the allied and equally noble houseof Conyers, was at Sockburn, situated on the same sweep of the Tees.Traces of the foundations of gardens and orchards alone point out thesite of the old house, where Dugdale in 1666 had noted the familyemblazonments in or on the building--the arms of Conyers, Vesci, Scrope,Neville, Dacre, FitzHugh, Lumley, and of the Royal Family. Surteessuggests that seven of the coats seem to have formed a rich armorialwindow, and that amidst them ran the motto, \"REGI SECVLOR I’ MORTALI I’VISIBILI SOLI DEO HONOR ET GLORIA I’ SECVLA SECVLOR.\" When the historianwrote, \"one old decaying Spanish chestnut\" seemed alone to connect thedeserted spot with some recollection of its ancient owners. Of the oldhouse not one stone remains. A new house was erected about a century agoby the baronet family of Blackett, who for some generations have ownedthe manor. Here the far-famed Conyers falchion is preserved. The sworddates from the thirteenth century, and has a blade 2 feet and 5½ incheslong. The handle is partly covered with ash, and has on the pommel twoshields, the three lions of England, and an eagle displayed. The crossis engraved with decorative foliage of the period.One of the most interesting specimens of the older fortified residenceswas Ludworth Tower.[14] The building, which consisted of athree-storeyed oblong tower of common limestone, stands near a brook, ona low hill, at the head of the valley in which Shadforth village lies. Alower vaulted room up till recently still contained a large openfireplace and hearthstone. The only entrance was by a small arched doorleading to a spiral stone staircase, projecting from the north-westangle of the tower. Remnants of a curtain wall exist to the east, and onthe west the adjoining ground has apparently been levelled by hand.The whole appearance of the building, which has, unfortunately, inrecent years[15] been allowed to fall into a ruinous condition, was darkand gloomy in the extreme. The date of its erection is fixed by thelicence obtained in 1422 by Sir Thomas Holden to embattle hismanor-house of Ludworth.At Bellasis, or Belasyse, another old house, with stone walls of greatthickness and moated, is now occupied by a farmer.Hollinside, an old mansion, associated with the Hardings, of whom RalphHarding the chronicler was a noteworthy member, still stands in ruins ona bank above the River Derwent. Originally three stories in height, andwith two wings forming the three sides of a narrow court. The fourth andeast side is arched over and surmounted by a tower. On the west side aturret projects in line with the south wall. The interior presentsseveral interesting features, and an outbuilding contains a largefireplace.Passing from the great homes of the county, and the older fortifiedtowers, we come to the time when, with the greater security accorded tothe minor gentry,[Illustration: RABY CASTLE IN 1783.]numerous manor-houses and country granges began to rise.Even at this time, spoiled as the county is for residential purposes, itrequires no strong effort of the imagination to picture the county as itwas in later Tudor times. The Bishops, greater than ever through thecollapse of the Nevilles, still appointed their foresters, and doubtlessoften made the dales resound with all the view-halloo of a gay hunt.Durham City became a stronghold of great ecclesiastical families, thesons and daughters of the prebendaries intermarrying with one another,and the descendants of successive Bishops allied themselves by crossmarriages. In the country better farmsteads became erected, andthroughout the shire the landowners began to erect more commodiousresidences. It is, with one or two exceptions, from this period that theolder halls and manor-houses still in existence date. It must not beforgotten that there were at this time no great landowners in the countyin the sense that we now understand the term, and almost every villagehad its own predominating squire.A few houses still remain, not so strongly built as the peel-towers, yetwell adapted to defence. Holmside Hall is one of these. Once one of theprincipal seats of the great House of Tempest, it was forfeited byRobert of that name, who, with his son Michael, had joined the Earls intheir rebellion, and therefore appears in Hall and Humberston’s Surveyas a \"capital messuage, with all the housings built of stone and coveredwith slate, with the orchards and gardens, within a park containingthree acres.\" Now sufficient remains to show that once the buildingswere ranged round a court and surrounded by a moat. The north side wasfaced by the chapel containing a still perfect west window of twotrefoil-headed lights under a square label, with the cinquefoil of theUmphrevilles and two blank shields in the spandrels. Above the window \"amutilated figure is fixed to the wall, with a full-moony face, and akind of round helmet,\" of which Surtees writes: \"I should almostconjecture this to be a rude piece of Roman sculpture, removed from thestation, which may possibly have furnished the coins and squared stonesused in building this chantry.\"The house itself is a curiously confused building of many differentperiods of architecture. The original gables were pulled down and thehouse enlarged to the south. The windows are mullioned and narrow andguarded with iron bars.After the Tempests’ fall the estate became the property of WilliamWhittingham, the bigoted Calvinist Dean, whose name deserves perpetualexecration as the destroyer of much that was old and beautiful in DurhamAbbey. It is possible that in the austere gloom that even now pervadesthe old house at Holmeside, he might find something sympathetic with hisown strange faith.The Isle, another Tempest residence, stands on low ground, surrounded bymarshes caused through risings of the Skerne. It is a picturesque place,with projecting gables and narrow mullioned lights. It was the residenceof Colonel John Tempest, first M.P. for Durham County, and still belongsto the Marquess of Londonderry as representative of his family.Sledwish Hall, standing lonely and sequestered, is a place of \"ghastlygrey renown.\" Upwards of a hundred years ago the bones of an infant werefound interred in a stone coffin in the field adjoining. The house, too,like most of these old mansions, is supposed to contain secret passagesand rooms. Portions of the present building, more particularly the southfront, date back to Plantagenet times, but the house as it now stands isan interesting specimen of Tudor architecture. It was rebuilt by JohnClopton, Queen Elizabeth’s Receiver, his great work being the ceiling inthe Orchard Chamber. This is divided into compartments by deepmouldings, ornamented by numerous crowned roses, fleurs-de-lis, andpomegranates. In the centre is a shield bearing his family arms, aquarterly shield, first and fourth, _paly a lion rampant_, and secondand third _a cross pattee fitchée_, over all a crescent for difference.The arms are reversed through the artist having formed his mould withoutconsidering that the impression was the final result. Two other shieldsimpressed from the same mould bear the initials E. C. (evidently for thebuilder’s wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Ralph Ashton of Great Lever, inLancashire), the date 1584, and \"a _tun_ with a rose _clapt on_.\"[16]Above this shield is a rose surrounded by three crowns. At the fourcorners of the room are large decorative groups; two are falcons withpomegranates, the third is a swan, and the fourth a boar under anoak-tree devouring an acorn. A deep cornice running round the wholeceiling is decorated with repeated devices of the Royal lion and theWelsh dragon supporting the crowned rose, the whole evidently symbolicof Good Queen Bess. There are several other good rooms, and a largechimney at the south-west is supported outside by three double brackets.There are several other interesting mansions in this district. AtCleatlam the old mansion of the Ewbankes still stands, gable-ended, withmullioned windows. It was sold by them in the troublous times of thegreat Civil War to the Somersets of Pauntley in Gloucester, and laterwas a seat of the Wards. Another old home of the Ewbanke family wasStaindrop Hall, at the east end of the village of that name. The familyarms, _three chevronels interlaced and on a chief three pellets_, are onone of the ceilings. Still another old house, once belonging to the samerace, was Snotterton Hall, which stood about a mile to the west ofStaindrop. Here the walls were embattled with crocketed pinnacles at thecorners, and the windows were triple mullioned lights under squarelabels. Over the entrance the arms and crest of the Bainbridges, whosold the estate to the Ewbankes in 1607, were sculptured. A portion ofthe house which was pulled down in 1831 is preserved in the present RabyGrange.Westholme Hall is another existing good specimen of Jacobeanarchitecture. It consists of a main building, with two gabled wings andmullioned windows. The date 1606, and the name IOHN DOWTHET on achimney-piece in the hall, points to its erection by the Douthwaites,who purchased the estate from the Boweses in 1603. Erected about thesame period, Gainford Hall still stands at the west end of the village.It, too, has gable ends and mullioned windows, and several of the roomsare wainscotted. One of the latter has a stuccoed border of flowers andfruit. Over the door is the three-garbed chevron of the Cradocks and theinscription IOHN : CRADOCK 1600.At Bishop Middleham a large old gable-ended house has a doorway withjambs and a pediment of carved freestone. It stands on the west side ofthe road leading to the church, and was originally the property of theWards, one of whom was Master of Sidney-Sussex College at Cambridge. In1738 it was the residence of Thomas Brunskill, whose daughter orgranddaughter married Edward Watson, of Ingleby Greenhow, in Yorkshire.Another picturesque fragment of the past is the old house now standingat the western end of Thorpe Thewles village. It is built of brick, withlow rooms, and is locally stated to have been visited by Queen Anne. Thetradition may possibly be a survival of one of our sovereigns’ passagethrough the county, but it is impossible that any crowned head can everhave rested in this old mansion. A few fields away a wing of the oncegreat house at Blakiston still stands. It alone remains to show wherethe birthplace of one of our great old families once stood, and is theonly remnant of the later home of the loyal house of Davison, two ofwhom were slain at the storming of Newcastle in 1644.Cotham Conyers, or Cotham Stob, derives its affix name[Illustration: GAINFORD HALL.][Illustration: THE OLD HALL AT THORPE THEWLES.]from its erstwhile owners, the Conyers, and is another old gable-endedmanor-house. It stands, surrounded by elms, near to a brook. The roomsare wainscotted, and over the fireplace in one of the rooms there was ahunting scene on the panel, depicting a stag at bay. One of the upperrooms was hung with tapestry. The estate was forfeited by the Conyersthrough Ralph Conyers having taken part in the Earls’ rebellion in 1569.Lying almost midway between the two Conyers’ seats of Cotham andSockburn stands the old home of the Killinghalls and Pembertons, atMiddleton St. George. The house formerly contained a painting, byFrancis Place, of \"A Pointer and Pheasants.\" An old cross in the gardenis said to have been brought from Neasham Abbey.Passing to the west of Darlington again, near the highroad leading toStaindrop, stands Thornton Hall, for many years the residence of abranch of the baronial family of Tailbois. It is a stone house, withhigh pitched gables, old-world red tiles, and mullioned windows, and haslong been used as a farmhouse. Above the window over the main entranceare two gargoyles. An interesting account of this house, with a numberof good sketches, may be found in Mr. G. A. Fothergill’s _Sketch-book_.Several miles north of Thornton, a small old mansion with gables andmullions may be seen at School Aycliffe, and not very far away, in anorth-westerly direction, the old grange of Midridge stands within anold walled garden, with a row of old elms leading along the road fromthe south. The house is a large treble-gable-ended building, and is saidto have been garrisoned by the Loyalist owner, Anthony Byerley, who wasa Colonel in the Royal army. His troopers are still locally known as\"Byerley’s Bull Dogs.\" A little to the south-west, the old house ofNewbiggin stands low, with solid stone walls, and the main staircase ofthe same substantial material. There was formerly a tower on the westend of the house.The hall at Coxhoe, erected about the year 1725 by John Burdon, has arichly decorated interior of contemporary date. In this house ElizabethBarrett Browning was born on March 6, 1806.The northern portion of the county does not contain so many houses ofinterest as the southern; there are, however, a few interestingmansions.Fen Hall, near Lanchester, is an interesting old house,[Illustration: FEN HALL.]dating from the Stuart period. It has the Greenwell arms over theentrance, and is now fast falling into a ruinous condition.[Illustration: A CORNER OF WASHINGTON HALL.]Washington Hall, a large, old stone mansion, built in the form of an E,with high-pitched roof and gable-ends, stands to the south side of thelow hill on which the church is built. The lights are divided by stonemullions and transoms. It was erected by the family of James, possiblyby the Bishop, and was, in Hutchinson’s time, the seat of theBracks.[17] It is now, like the old hall at Rainton, in a pitiablestate, and let in tenements.In the neighbourhood of Sunderland there are several interesting houses.High Barnes, for long the home of the Ettricks, is now a convent, andhas been considerably altered. Low Barnes, the Pembertons’ old home, islet to a laundry company. Ford Hall is a comparatively modern house, butis interesting as having been the birthplace of General Havelock.Pallion Hall, an old stone mansion, has recently been pulled down.The old hall at West Boldon is more modern, having been erected in 1709by the Fawcetts. The house has the arms of that family over the mainentrance, and several of the rooms are wainscotted. A quaint record ofanother generation may well be noted in the late Mr. Boyle’s own words:\"On one of the window-panes in a bedroom, in a neat hand of the earlypart of last century, someone has written with a diamond:    \"Beautifull Grace Andrew.\"On the next pane, in equally delicate script, another hand has added:    \"Fair written Name, yet fairer in my heart,     No Diamond cutts so deep as Cupid’s Dart.\"Travelling by railway from Boldon to Newcastle, the house now known asthe Mulberry Inn is a familiar object, just outside of Felling station.It has been a picturesque building, and for long was the residence ofthe Brandlings. It is now undergoing a serious alteration. A smallstone summer-house, once in the garden, still stands on one of thestation platforms.[Illustration: THE DOORWAY, WEST RAINTON HALL.]Kibblesworth Hall, a few miles south of Gateshead, is a solid Jacobeanbrick house, with stone-mullioned, square-headed windows. It has a fineoak staircase, and some of the fireplaces and cornices are ofcontemporary date. The house has been let in tenements to the pitmen ofthe adjoining colliery, the stables turned into cottages, and thegardens into allotments. Another old house that has undergone a similarfate is West Rainton Hall, erected about 1690 by Sir John Duck, Bart. Itstands on the main street of the village, shorn of the battlementsmentioned by Surtees, but still retaining a fine old doorway,reminiscent of its better days.There are also in this district several other old houses dismantled andin tenements, betokening the scattering of their once owners to many farlands. It is a pleasure to turn from these to a few houses still in goodcondition. The Hall,[18] Houghton-le-Spring, was perhaps erected byRobert Hutton, Rector of Houghton, between the years 1589 and 1623,although its erection is more popularly attributed to his grandson andnamesake. This later Robert Hutton was Captain of a troop of horse inthe Parliamentary army, and, like Dobson of Harlow Hill,      \" ... went to Dundee    And when he came back      held his head hee.\"With the proceeds of this expedition he is supposed to have built thehouse in which his descendants dwelt for many generations. To satisfysome scruple of his conscience, or, according to another story, to lienear a favourite horse, he was buried in his garden under an altar-tomb,inscribed:     \"Hic Jacet Robertvs Hvtton armiger qvi obiit Avg die nono 1680. Et     moriendo vivet.\"Stella Hall, a picturesque Elizabethan structure, situated close to theRiver Tyne, was erected by the Tempests on the site of a nunnery, andstill contains some tapestry representing the story of Hero and Leander.Scattered up and down the dales are many other old homes that a writerdealing with his homeland would love to touch upon, but space forbids.Even these short notes are all too short. The old mansions of ourcountryside are a much neglected feature of archæology, and each housein itself demands photographs and drawings and a chapter quite as longas this.DURHAM ASSOCIATIONS OF JOHN WESLEYBY THE REV. T. CYRIL DALE, B.A.A packet of old letters suggests many questions as to the writers, whomthey have long survived. Nor is this curiosity diminished when one ofthe correspondents has achieved a world-wide fame, so that there is noportion of the globe where his name is not known. For then one desiresto know who were the people whom he honoured with his friendship, and toscan the letters closely to see if they throw any new light upon thecharacter of the writer. There are in existence seventeen letterswritten by John Wesley to a member of a family once well-known in thecounty of Durham. Originally there were thirty letters, as appears fromthe numbering of those which remain, but where the other letters are thewriter does not know.[19] These seventeen letters, two of them beingonly copies of the originals, came into the possession of the Rev.Thomas Dale, Canon of St. Paul’s from 1843-70, and from him passed tohis eldest son, the Rev. Thomas Pelham Dale (1821-92), at one timewell-known as the Rector of St. Vedast in the city of London.[20] Theywere written to Miss Margaret Dale, second daughter of Edward Dale[21]of Tunstall, who, owing to the extinction (as it seems) of the elderbranch of the family in the male line, was head of the family of Dale,first of Dalton le Dale, and then of Tunstall. This Edward Dale was theson of Thomas Dale by his wife Margaret, daughter and co-heiress ofGeorge Middleton of Silksworth. Through her Burke, who was far tooamiable a genealogist to doubt the assertions of any one respecting hisancestors, however remote, traces the descent of Edward Dale fromGundreda, daughter of William the Conqueror. The curious will find thedescent set out at length in Burke’s _Royal Family_, Pedigree XVI.Edward Dale married Eleanor, youngest of the three daughters of the Rev.John Lawrence, Rector of Bishop’s Wearmouth. Mr. Lawrence (1668-1732)was in his day a well-known writer on horticulture, and has, as aconsequence, a niche in that temple of fame--the _Dictionary of NationalBiography_. It is related that when in 1721 he was appointed to theRectory, he was so obnoxious to the principal inhabitants of his parish,owing to his Hanoverian proclivities, that when he was \"reading himselfin\" the three chief landowners of the place--John Goodchild of Pallion,John Pemberton of Bainbridge Holme, and Thomas Dale of Tunstall--walkedout of the church as a protest against his appointment.[22] By a kind ofpoetic justice, his three daughters married into the families of thethree protesters. His eldest daughter married the above-named JohnGoodchild, his two younger daughters the sons and heirs of JohnPemberton and Thomas Dale. Only unfortunately for the completeness ofthe tale, the two last marriages did not take place till after the deathof John Lawrence.By Eleanor Lawrence, Edward Dale had three daughters--Mary, Margaret,and Anne--and one son, also called Edward. He died when his eldestdaughter was only eleven and his son still an infant.Margaret Dale no doubt made the acquaintance of John Wesley through hisdevoted adherent, Margaret Lewen. Miss Lewen, the only child of ThomasLewen of Kibblesworth, while still a girl of about twenty-two, wasattracted by the preaching of John Wesley during his visit to the Northin the year 1764. Wesley, in his famous \"Diary,\" speaks of her as being\"a remarkable monument of Divine mercy. She broke through allhindrances, and joined heart and hand with the children of God.\" She was\"a pattern to all young women of fortune in England.\" Margaret Lewen wascertainly exceedingly liberal. \"In works of benevolence and Christianzeal, she cheerfully expended an ample income\" (Stamp: Orphan House ofWesley, London, 1863). Wesley says she had about £600 a year \"in her ownhands.\" On one of his visits to the North she gave him a chaise and apair of horses. Now, Margaret Lewen was very intimate with the Dalegirls, and it was probably through her influence that they came intocontact with the great preacher. Whether any letters were written to theother sisters is not known, but they can hardly have been so numerous ormore intimate than those written to Margaret Dale.The first letter extant is written from Portpatrick, and is dated June1, 1765, when Margaret Dale was still two or three months short oftwenty-one. It begins: \"My Dear Miss Peggy,\" and ends, \"I trust you willbe happier every day; and that you will not forget, my Dear Sister, yourAffectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\" The letter is occupied with spiritualcounsels, and questions about her spiritual health. He inquires: \"Howfar do you find Power over your Thoughts? Does not your imaginationsometimes wander? Do those imaginations continue for any time?\" It isclear, from Wesley’s next letter, written from Kilkenny, dated July 5,1765, that Miss Peggy had found she was guilty of wandering thoughts,for the letter begins: \"My dear Sister,--Altho’ it is certain the kindof Wandering Thoughts wch you mention, are consistent with pure Love,yet it is highly desirable to be delivered from yᵐ, because (as youobserve) they hinder profitable thoughts.\" Miss Lewen is mentioned. \"Ihope Miss Lewen and you speak to each other, not only without Disguise,but without Reserve.\" The letter ends, \"My Dear Sister, youraffectionate Brother.\"Letters 4 and 5 are missing. The next, numbered 6, is dated from London,November 6, 1765. Peggy has a fixed idea that she will not live beyondthe age of three and twenty. Wesley, in this letter, asks many questionsabout this conviction. He wants to know when it began, and whether itcontinues the same, whether her health is better or worse. The subjectis continued in the next letter, written December 31 in the same year.This letter begins \"My dear Peggy,\" and ends, \"I cannot tell you howtenderly I am, my Dear Sister, your affectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\"Wesley had evidently a tender paternal regard for the girl. He was in1765 sixty-two years of age, fifteen years older than her father wouldhave been if he had survived. Peggy was mistaken in her conviction. Shedid not actually die till November, 1777, when she had completed herthirty-third year, so she was just ten years out. Letter 9, writtenApril, 1766, from Manchester, contains nothing of interest. Numbers 10and 11 are unfortunately missing. Number 12 shows that Peggy desired togo to Leytonstone, where there was a considerable colony of Wesleyans,and whither perhaps Margaret Lewen had already gone. Wesley was veryanxious she should not go. \"I am afraid,\" he writes, \"if you go toLaton-Stone you will give up Perfection. I mean by placing it so high,as I fear none will ever attain. I know _not one_ in London that hasever largely conversed with Sally Ryan, who has not given it up, thatis, with regard to their own Experience. Now this, I think, would doyou no good at all. Nay, I judge, it wou’d do you much hurt: it would bea substantial Loss. But I do not see how you _cou’d_ possibly avoid thatloss, without a free intercourse with me, both in Writing and Speaking.Otherwise I know and feel, I can give you up, tho’ you are exceedingnear and dear to me. But if you was to be moved from your Stedfastnessthat wᵈ give me pain indeed. You will write immediately to, my DearPeggy, your Affectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\"The next two letters are missing, so that we do not know if Peggy obeyedJohn Wesley or no, though from the tone of the next letter it seemsprobable that she did so. The next letter is dated November 7, 1766.Margaret Lewen had died at Leytonstone, October 30. By her will, datedNovember 21, 1764, she left many legacies to various Methodist goodworks, and to John Wesley £1,000, and her residuary estate to be appliedas he should \"think fit for the furtherance of the Gospel.\" She leftMary Dale £1,000, and to her sisters Margaret and Ann Dale, £100 apiece.Her father threatened to dispute the will, and the matter wascompromised by the surrender to him of the residuary estate.John Wesley refers to Margaret Lewen’s death in the fifteenth letter:\"How happy it is to sit loose to all below! Just now I find a paper onwch is wrote (in Miss Lewen’s hand), ‘March 24, 1762, Margaret Dale, AnnDale, Margaret Lewen, wonder in what state of life they will be in theyear 1766.’ How little did any of you think at that time that she wouldthen be in Eternity: But she now wonders at nothing and grieves atnothing.\" He ends: \"And sure neither Life nor Death shall separate youfrom, my Dear Sister, your Affectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\"In the eighteenth letter--the sixteenth contains nothing of especialinterest, the seventeenth is missing--Wesley speaks of his followers atNewcastle: \"Those you mention are Israelites indeed to whom you will dowell to speak with all freedom. A few more in Newcastle are of the samespirit: Altho’ they are but few in whom ye Gold is free from dross. Iwish you could help poor Molly Stralliger. I am often afraid for herlest she shᵈ be ignorant of Satan’s devices, and lose all that GOD hadwrought in her.\"The twentieth letter we give in full, not because it is more interestingthan the other letters, but because it has not before appeared in publicprint.[23] The other letters will be found in the _Life and Letters ofThomas Pelham Dale_, by his daughter, Helen Pelham Dale, published byGeorge Allen, 1894. The whereabouts of this letter was not then known,but it has since been unearthed from a collection of autographs made bya connection of the family. Possibly the other missing letters may be inother collections. The letter is dated from Athlone, June 19, 1767: \"Mydear Peggy, By conversing with you, I should be overpaid for coming twoor three hundred miles round about. But how it will be I know not yet.If a ship be ready for Whitehaven, then I shall arrive at Whitehaven orNewcastle, otherwise I must sail for Holyhead or Chester. I hope you nowagain find the increased witness that you are saved from sin. There is adanger in being content without it, into which you may easily reasonyourself. You may easily bring yourself to believe there is no need ofit, especially while you are in an easy and peaceful state. But bewareof this. The Witness of Sanctification as well as of Justification, isye privilege of God’s Children, and you may have the one always clear aswell as ye other if you walk humbly and closely with God. In what statedo you find your mind now? Full of Faith and Love? Praying always? ThenI hope you always remember my Dear Peggy, Your affectionate Brother, J.Wesley.\"Before Wesley wrote again he had been to Newcastle and had seen Peggy.The letter is dated from Witney, August 27, and is, as usual, veryaffectionate in tone: \"I thought it was hardly possible for me to loveyou better than I did before I came last to Newcastle. But your artless,simple, undisguised Affection exceedingly increased mine. At the sametime it increased my Confidence in you so that I feel you areunspeakably near and dear to me.\" He adds in a postscript, \"Don’t forgetwhat you have learnt in Music.\" Possibly Peggy had been showing herfriend her accomplishments. Possibly, too, she had learnt her music froma certain young man, Edward Avison, afterwards organist of St. Nicholas’Church, Newcastle. If this were the case, her teacher taught Peggysomething else beside music, for she afterwards married him.In the next letter we get glimpses of two people famous in the Methodistworld of the day, George Whitefield, and Darcy, Lady Maxwell. Of GeorgeWhitefield it is unnecessary to speak. Lady Maxwell was the daughter ofThomas Brisbane of Brisbane in Ayrshire, and the widow of Sir WalterMaxwell, fourth Baronet, of Pollock. Left a childless widow in 1757, shebecame a follower of John Wesley, though she did not formally join theMethodists till many years later. She provided the money for buildingthe school at Kingswood.Wesley writes: \"I hope Mr. Whitefield was an instrument of good atNewcasle, and a means of stirring up Some. He is very affectionate andvery lively and his word seldom falls to the ground: tho’ he does notfrequently speak of the deep things of GOD, or the Height of yePromises. But you say not one word of Lady Maxwell? Did she call atNewcastle going and coming? Did you converse with her alone? And did shebreak thro’ her Natural and habitual Shyness? How did you find her?Seeking Heavenly things alone, and all athirst for _God_? It will be amiracle of miracles if she stands, considering the thousand snares thatsurround her. I have much satisfaction when I consider in how differenta situation you and my Dear Molly Dale are. You have every outwardAdvantage for Holiness wch an indulgent Providence can give.\"[24]The correspondence now begins to slacken. Peggy has accused him of notanswering her last letter; in reply Wesley writes from Liverpool, April1, 1768. \"I do not understand what Letter you mean. I have answer’d (ifI do not forget) every letter which I have receiv’d, and I commonlyanswer either of you within a day or two. In this respect, I do not loveto remain in your debt. In others I must always be so, for I can neverpay you the Affection I owe. Accept of what little I have to give.... Ihope to be at Glasgow on Wednesday the 19th instant, at Aberdeen ye28th, at Edinburgh May 5th, at Newcastle on Friday May 20th.\"The next letter dated June 30, 1768, may be described as a very brieftreatise on Sanctification. Then there is a gap of nearly a year, thenext letter being dated May 20, 1769. Peggy has had to endure a greattrial. Her sister Molly married a Mr. John Collinson of London. The_Newcastle Courant_ of April 29, 1769, thus announces the fact:\"Thursday, was married at St. Andrew’s, Mr. John Collinson of London toMiss Dale of Northumberland Street, daughter of the late Mr. Dale ofTunstall, near Sunderland, a most agreeable young lady, endowed withevery qualification to render the marriage state happy, with a fortuneof £2,000.\" But Peggy felt her sister’s defection much. Wesley wasstrongly in favour of the single life both for men and women. He hadpublished a treatise in favour of celibacy, entitled _Thoughts on aSingle Life_. It is true that he himself afterwards married in the year1751, but, as his matrimonial experiences were distinctly unfortunate(he separated from his wife for ever after five years of married life),he was not unnaturally more than ever firmly convinced of the advantageof celibacy.[25] Peggy was as yet quite sure that John Wesley was rightin this as in everything else.He comforts her thus: \"The hearing from my Dear Peggy at this criticaltime gives me a particular satisfaction. I wanted to know, How you boresuch a trial, a wound in the tenderest part. You have now a first proofthat the God whom you serve, is able to deliver you in every trial. Youfeel and yet conquer.... I hope you are delivered not only from_repining_ with regard to Her, but from _reasoning_ with regard toyourself. You still see the more excellent way, and are sensible of theadvantages you enjoy. I allow _some_ single women have fewer Advantagesfor Eternity than they might have in a married State. But, blessed beGOD you have all the Advantages wch one can well conceive.... O may youimprove every advantage to the uttermost. And give more and more comfortto, my Dear Peggy, your Affectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\"There is one more letter from London, November 17, 1769, encouragingPeggy to persevere in her work for others. Then the letters cease.Perhaps there were more letters which have been lost, or were perchancedestroyed by the recipient. Wesley, with his zeal for celibacy, canhardly have liked the news of his Peggy’s engagement to Edward Avison.He was organist of St. Nicholas’, Newcastle, in succession to hisfather, Charles Avison,[26] once a well-known musician in the North ofEngland. He was three years younger than Peggy. Their married life wasshort. They were married March, 1773: Edward Avison died October, 1776,aged twenty-nine; and Peggy in November, 1777, aged thirty-three. Theyleft no children. Their monument in the churchyard of St. Andrew’sChurch, Newcastle, says: \"They were eminent for piety and primitivesimplicity of manners; having each borne a lingering disease with themost exemplary patience and resignation, they rejoiced at the approachof death.\" Perhaps Wesley visited Newcastle during the last year of hisdear Peggy’s life, and was able to minister spiritual consolation toher. Let us hope that any breach that Peggy’s marriage may have madebetween her and one who loved her with so tender and paternal anaffection was cured by the approach of Death, the great Healer.Little remains to be said. Mary Collinson lived to 1812, and left afamily of two sons, George Dale and John Collinson, and three daughters,Ann Collinson, Thermuthis Collinson, and Mary, the wife of ChristopherGodmond. It is not known if any of her descendants are alive to-day; ifthere be any such, they may very likely possess the missing letters. AnnDale never married, and lived till 1820. Edward, their brother, died in1826, having seen five of his six sons die before him without issue. Hiseldest and only surviving son, also Edward, lived till 1862, and thendied childless. With him died out the senior branch of the family ofDale of Dalton-le-Dale and Tunstall. Since his death there have been noDales of this family residing in the Bishopric. How the letters writtenby John Wesley came into the possession of Canon Dale, or Canon Dale’sfather, William Dale, is not known. Possibly Anne Dale gave them toWilliam Dale, or her brother may have given them to his son. It iscertain that to that son’s careful preservation of them we owe thisintimate revelation of the great revivalist’s affection for a Durhamgirl.THE OLD FAMILIES OF DURHAMBY HENRY R. LEIGHTONThe evil fate that has attended the old houses in this county hasfollowed equally relentlessly the families who once dwelled therein.Here and there, it is true, a family still exists that has weathered thestorms of long centuries; one or two, perhaps, may be pointed out thathave increased their acreage as the long years went by; and perhapsanother two or three whose lands remain with daughters’ heirs.With few exceptions, almost all the families of importance in feudaldays have passed away. The great House of Neville,[27] that oncethreatened to overshadow the Lords Palatine themselves, survives only inseveral southern branches, and their name is almost forgotten in theirnative land. The baronial houses of Eure,[28] Conyers, Hylton, andFitzMarmaduke have all passed away. So, too, have nearly all the namesrecorded in the Heralds’ Visitations at intervals from 1530 to 1666. Ofthe latter, eight only retain their patrimonial acres. These are theChaytors, Edens, Lambtons, Liddells, Lumleys, Salvins, Vanes, andWhartons. To these may be added the Williamsons, who came fromNottinghamshire, and the Shaftos from Northumberland.The Visitations of Durham[29] are, like those of the sister county ofNorthumberland, notoriously incomplete. Of the latter, Surtees wrote:\"The Northumbrian gentry, many of whom probably never heard of theVisitation, would scarcely leave their business or amusements to attendan Officer of Arms for a purpose of which few then saw the utility, andwhich, it is plain, in many instances was considered an extremenuisance.\" In the adjoining county to the south there was a similarstate of affairs. Of Dugdale’s _Visitation of York_, Mr. Davies wrote:\"Nearly one-third of the whole number of gentry whom the herald calledupon to appear before him with proofs of their arms and pedigreestreated his summonses with neglect.\"In this county both a long and a strong list of families of gentle bloodcan easily be enumerated who, for one reason or another, make noappearance in the Heralds’ books. No one familiar with the history ofthe county can have helped remarking the absence of families formerly sowell known, and in many cases still well known, as the Allgoods ofBradley, Blacketts of Hoppyland, Bromleys of Nesbitt, Dales of Dalton,Douthwaites of Westholme, Emersons of Westgate, Goodchilds of Pallion,Greenwells of Greenwell and Stobilee, Holmeses of Wearmouth, Hunters ofMedomsley, Ironsides of Houghton, Meaburns of Pontop, and others whosenames spin out too long a list to give in full. Now, most of thesefamilies had intermarried with families who registered and had writtenthemselves as \"gentlemen\" for several generations; and, as aninteresting sidelight upon the Visitations, we believe it could be shownthat more than one family who registered was in debt pretty heavily toothers who didn’t register. So it does not appear to have beenaltogether a matter of means.It may perhaps be as well, before proceeding farther, to notice theprincipal material we have, in addition to the Visitations, for provingthe succession to estate in this county.Durham, being a separate regality, is not included in the Domesday Book,and our earliest record is the Boldon Book, dated some years later,being compiled by order of Bishop Pudsey in 1183. Later there is asurvey of the county, made by order of Bishop Hatfield, who ruled from1345 to 1381. From the time of Bishop Beaumont (1318-33) the successionmay be proved by the inquisitions post-mortem taken upon the death ofevery owner. These documents were formerly kept at Durham, but are now,with many other local records, in London.With these must be mentioned the Halmote Rolls, commencing in 1349,containing a record of all holders of the Bishop’s lands and otherrecords of the cursitors. The Durham Chancery Proceedings, also now inthe Record Office, are full of the most interesting informationrespecting local families.The wills of residents in the Bishopric from the sixteenth centuryonwards are of great value. A few also of the parish registers withinthe diocese commence towards the end of the same century, but themajority do not date with any regularity until another hundred years hadpassed.Limited space forbids any lengthy account of the families individually,and a few passing notices must suffice. Amongst the existing\"indigenous\" families, as Surtees calls them, the Lumleys must bear thepalm, not for length of pedigree, but for the long period they haveranked amongst the greater nobility.Probably for some generations before, and certainly from, the days ofUchtred, Lord of Lumley, _temp._ King Stephen, the family has held highrank. Marmaduke de Lumley, who was in right of his mother one of thecoheirs of the barony of Thweng, made an interesting change in thefamily arms. His father had borne a scarlet shield with six silverpopinjays, whilst his mother’s family arms were a golden shield, thereona fess gules. Marmaduke dispensed with three of the popinjays, andplaced his mother’s fess between the remaining three, two above it andone below. His son Sir Ralph, the builder of the castle at Lumley, wassummoned to Parliament as a Baron in the eighth year of Richard II.’sreign. Yorkist in sympathy, he joined in an unfortunate attempt tooverthrow the fourth Henry in the year that monarch grasped the throne,and was killed at Cirencester in a skirmish. One of his younger sons,Marmaduke, was successively Bishop of Carlisle and Lincoln, and LordHigh Treasurer of England. John de Lumley, Sir Ralph’s second but eldestsurviving son, was restored to his father’s estates by King Henry,became a distinguished leader in the French wars, and was slain on thefield of Baugé in 1421. The successor, his only son Thomas, was summonedto Parliament in his grandfather’s barony in 1461, the attainder of thelatter being reversed upon petition.Third in descent from the last-named peer, John, the fifth Baron, tookpart in the great victory of Flodden. He lived to see his son and heir,George Lumley, beheaded for high treason, and attainted, for taking partin the Pilgrimage of Grace.George Lumley’s son, John Lumley, was recreated a Peer in 1547, hisfather’s attainder being reversed. This John, Lord Lumley, must havebeen something of an Oriental in his philosophy. He was strongly imbuedwith the spirit of ancestor-worship. It was he who brought two stonemonuments from Durham Abbey under the belief that they were of hisforefathers, and set them up with a long line of effigies representingevery generation of his house from a remote period. The rooms at Lumleywere also hung with a series of portraits of the same individuals by hisdirection. About the origin of these the late Mr. Planché advanced aninteresting theory, printed in 1866, in the _Journal of the BritishArchæological Association_.Lord Lumley appears to have impressed his family importance upon WilliamJames, the contemporary Bishop of Durham, whose repetition of thepedigree so astonished that modern Solomon, King James I., that thelatter evidently thought the Bishop was taking a rise out of him. \"By mysaul, I didna ken Adam’s name was Lumley!\" said the Sovereign. Doubtlessthis was a natural exclamation, for it was the King’s first meeting witha pedigree drawn up by an Elizabethan Herald. He would meet others as hetravelled farther South!The estates passed on the death of this peer to a second cousin, SirRichard Lumley. Created in 1628 a Viscount in the Peerage of Ireland,Sir Richard in later years was known as a gallant Royalist, and one ofPrince Rupert’s trusted officers.His son, another Richard, one of the commanders of the Royal army atSedgemoor, was advanced in 1690 to the Earldom of Scarborough. Littlemore remains to be said, beyond that Lumleys have taken part in almostevery war since that date (one, Sir William, commanded the cavalry atAlbuera; and another, a captain in the navy, was killed on the _Isis_ in1782), and that Lumley Castle is still the seat of the Earls ofScarborough.Closely allied to the Lumleys by marriage, the Lambtons have owned theadjoining estate of Lambton from the twelfth century. Their connectionwith the curious legend of the Lambton Worm has made the name widelyknown in the North. From the fifteenth century onwards the family wereperhaps most remarkable for the brilliant series of marriages thesuccessive owners of the estate made. Matches with Rokeby of Rokeby,Lumley of Ludworth, the Lords Eure, the Tempests of Stella, and theCurwens of Workington, each either bringing additional lands to thehouse, or else widening and extending the family influence, came to aclimax with the marriage of Ralph Lambton, in 1696, with DorothyHedworth, heiress to great estates on the north bank of the river. Thegreat-grandson of this marriage was the celebrated Radical Earl ofDurham, whose life has been told in recent years by Mr. Stuart Reid.The Greenwells are the third ancient house in this county who stilldwell on the lands from which they take their name. At the time ourearliest record, the Boldon Book, was compiled, William the Priest[30]held lands at Greenwell, in the green valley of Wolsingham, and hissons, James and Richard de Greenwell, took their surname from theirhome. From their generation through long centuries Greenwell succeededGreenwell, until the death of Henry Greenwell in 1890. The estate thenpassed to his brother’s daughter, Mrs. Fletcher, who sold Greenwellwithin the last few years to her kinsman, Sir Walpole Eyre Greenwell,Bart.Like other families, as the years passed by, younger sons foundedbranches, some of which flourished and became even more influential thanthe parent stem.Anthony Greenwell, a son of Peter Greenwell of Wolsingham, and grandsonof Peter Greenwell of Greenwell, living in the reign of Henry VIII., isstated to have settled at Corbridge, in the adjoining county ofNorthumberland. His son Ralph became allied by marriage to a number ofinfluential families; the administration issued after the death of hisfather-in-law, Ralph Fenwick of Dilston, in[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN LAMBTON.]1623, showing that the latter left five daughters, his coheirs. Ofthese, Isabel, the eldest, married Ralph Greenwell, Mary married JohnSwinburne, Agnes was wife to John Orde, Margaret to George Tempest ofWinlaton, and Barbara married William Harrison.Ralph’s grandson Nicholas, so named after his mother’s father NicholasLeadbitter of Warden, married, in 1683, Frances Whitfield, and theirson, Whitfield Greenwell, a captain in the army, was killed at theBattle of Glenshiels in 1719. From his grandson, John Greenwell, of theIndia House, the present Sir Walpole Greenwell is lineally descended.A second branch of the family has long been known as the Greenwells ofGreenwell Ford, thus curiously taking their name from the old home inWolsingham parish and giving it to the new (though its very newness hasnow grown green with age) home near Lanchester.Thomas Greenwell, probably a younger son of John Greenwell of Greenwell,living _circa_ 1440, took up his abode at Stobilee, in the parish ofSatley (the vill of which had been held in chief in the early days ofthe fourteenth century by Robert de Greenwell), and there hisdescendants resided until the time of the Commonwealth, when the thenhead of the family, William Greenwell, was sequestered as a Royalist,his lands being taken from him, and let to Henry Blackett by theParliamentary Commissioners.Nicholas Greenwell, a younger brother of the Royalist William, foundedthe house of Ford, purchasing that estate in 1633. He married atMedomsley, in 1623, Mary Kirkley, probably a near relative of MichaelKirkley of Newcastle, whose daughter married the first Sir WilliamBlackett. This Michael Kirkley mentions in his will, which he made in1620, amongst other relatives, his cousin, Mr. William Greenwell theelder, of London, merchant, to whom William Camden, the Herald, hadconfirmed in 1602 \"the antient armes of the worshipfull family ofGreenwell, of Grenewell Hill, in the County Palatine of Duresme, fromwhich the said William Greenwell is descended.\" This London branch ofthe family ended with an heiress, who married Thomas Legh, of Ridge, inCheshire.Returning to Nicholas Greenwell of Ford, he died in 1640, and was buriedamongst his ancestors at Lanchester. His son, another William, addedlands at Kibblesworth to the paternal estate by marriage with an heiressof the Cole family. He died at an advanced age in 1701, when his eldestson, Nicholas, succeeded to Greenwell Ford, whilst Kibblesworth passedto his younger son, Robert. The latter was great-grandfather of the lateMajor-General Sir Leonard Greenwell, K.C.B., who, in 1820, acted asgodfather to the present venerable head of the family, the author ofGreenwell’s Glory, one of, if not, the best trout flies known.Other branches of the family have flourished for awhile and thendisappeared. In 1697 William Greenwell of Whitworth acquired a moiety,including the mansion-house of Great Chilton, where his descendantslived for some three generations. One of his daughters married CuthbertSmith, whose brother Ralph became his heir. This hunting squirebequeathed his property, for no other reason but that they had oftenridden together    \"From the drag to the chase, from the chase to the view,     From the view to the death in the morning,\"to Robert Surtees of Milkwellburn.At a much earlier date another William Greenwell owned a fair estate atNeasham, and dying in 1619 left two daughters, Margaret aged three andEleanor two years, as his heirs. His widow married Marmaduke Wyville,and the daughters respectively became the wives of John Taylor ofAppleton, and Ralph Hedworth of Pokerley.One other branch, still surviving, must not be passed over. The estateof Broomshields near to Satley has belonged to Greenwells from as farback as 1488, when one of the many Peters lived there. Therepresentation of the Maddisons of Hole House in the Derwent Valley, afamily celebrated in local history and ballad, passed into this familyby marriage in 1774. A later owner of Broomshields, John Greenwell,married Elizabeth, daughter of Alan Greenwell of Ford, and thusre-united the two families.Many years have passed since Robert Surtees wrote: \"_Sic transit._ Weknow not what are become of the descendants of Bulmer, whose ancestorsheld Brancepeth and Middleham Castles. The family of Conyers, which hashad Parliamentary lords, and once consisted of nine or ten flourishingbranches (excepting some remains in the South), is reduced to a singleBaronet’s title without a fortune, and the probable descendants ofSurtees of Dinsdale are ignorant of their own origin, whilst the chiefmale line is either extinct or steeped in poverty and oblivion.\"The great house of Surtees derives, as its name implies, its origin froma family resident to a remote period on the banks of the River Tees.William, the son of Siward, was living there in the reign of Henry II.,and his son Ralph was the first to style himself Sur Tees, the familyresidence being then, as for many long years afterwards, at Dinsdale,the adjoining seat to Sockburn where the Conyers family dwelt.Of the dissolution of this head house of the race, Mr. Surtees added: \"Idiscovered by a remarkable deed at Durham (unknown to Hutchinson) howthe estates went to Brandling in prejudice of Marmaduke, heir male ofthe half-blood; and that Marmaduke’s grandson Thomas sold most of whatremained in the male line; but I cannot find further as to this Thomasexcept that his younger brother Richard married and had two sons, Robertand Richard, who are the last I can trace of this branch, the undoubteddirect heirs.\"The existing branches of this old family now resident at Redworth Hall,Mainsforth, and Hamsterley, derive their descent from a William Surteeswho, in the year 1440, acquired lands in Whickham under the HalmoteCourt, his sureties being Robert Boutflower and Thomas Gibson.His descendants for some generations resided within the parishes ofWhickham in this county, and Ovingham in Northumberland.Edward Surtees strengthened the family by marrying in 1617 MargaretCoulson, whose mother was sister and heir of Robert Surtees, Aldermanand twice Mayor of Durham.The eldest son of this marriage was ancestor of the famous beauty, BessySurtees, who ran away with and married John Scott, afterwards Lord Eldonand Chancellor of Great Britain.The second son, Robert Surtees of Ryton, added to his inheritance bymarrying an heiress of the Hauxley family. He purchased Mainsforth andfounded the two families now owning that seat and Redworth, and amongsthis descendants was Robert Surtees the historian, to whom his nativecounty owes an everlasting debt.The Surtees of Hamsterley Hall trace their descent from a CuthbertSurtees of Ebchester who died in 1622, and whose relationship to theOvingham family is not at present clear. His son Anthony, however, heldthe Hollins in Ovingham parish in 1629, and that property in 1586 was inthe possession of Rowland Surtees, who died the following year, and whowas brother of William Surtees, ancestor of the families alreadymentioned.Hamsterley descended to Robert Smith Surtees, the author of somewell-known sporting novels.The Edens are almost certainly an indigenous family, for there can bebut little doubt that they derive their name from the village of Eden,now called Castle Eden. The family for a number of generations residedat Preston-on-Tees,[Illustration: HOPPYLAND PARK.]where lands were held by Robert de Eden in 1413. A succession ofThomases and Williams bring the pedigree into the sixteenth century,when John Eden married an heiress of the Lambtons. After the heads ofthe house successively increased the family patrimony by marryingheiresses of the Hutton, Welbury, and Bee families, John Eden’sgreat-great-grandson, Robert by name, followed his ancestor’s example bymarrying another Lambton heiress. He was Member for the county and wascreated a Baronet in 1672. Sir Robert Eden, the third Baronet, had alarge and distinguished family. His second son Robert was Governor ofMaryland, and created a Baronet in 1776. He was ancestor of the presentSir William Eden, who succeeded also to the inheritance of thefirst-named Sir Robert’s eldest son, and is thus doubly a Baronet. TheGovernor’s next brother, Sir Robert’s third son, was the distinguishedstatesman, William Lord Auckland, and the fifth son, Sir Morton Eden, aneminent diplomatist, was created Baron Henley, and was ancestor of thepresent peer. One of the sisters of this talented trio married JohnMoore, Archbishop of Canterbury, and another married the Rev. RichardRichardson, Chancellor of St. Paul’s.Several old families have for many generations dwelt in the Valley ofthe Derwent, and were all more or less intermarried with each other.Thomas Hunter, about the end of the fourteenth century, married MargaretLayton, heiress, through her mother, of the family of Alanshields ofAlanshields. A century later quite a small clan of the Hunters wereresident up and down the valley, but principally at Medomsley. Here in1675 was born Dr. Christopher Hunter, the celebrated antiquary; and herenearly a century later, in 1757, General Sir Martin Hunter, G.C.M.G.,first saw the light.The Stevensons were another Derwentside family, whose name is best knownthrough John Hall, the _Eugenius_ of Sterne, having taken it when hemarried the heiress of Ambrose Stevenson of Byerside.The Shaftos have in various branches been closely connected with thecounty for many centuries. The late Rev. John Hodgson, in an earlyvolume of the _Archæologia Æliana_, throws doubt upon the traditionaldescent of the Shaftos in the male line from the Folliots. Heoverlooked, however, several important facts that at least render theassertion possible. The Fenwick of which the Folliots were Lords is notthe Fenwick in Northumberland as he assumed, but the place of that namein Yorkshire which passed by the marriage of Margaret Folliot to herhusband, Sir Hugh Hastings, and long continued in his family.Cuthbert, son of John Folliot of Fenwick, is said to have acquired landsat Shafto in Northumberland by marrying one of the heirs of RogerWelwick of that place, and his descendants took the local name; anotherdaughter of Roger is stated in the Visitation of Rutland, 1618, to havemarried a Bryan Harbottle. A comparison of the arms of the respectivefamilies shows that the Shafto coat is merely the Folliot armsdifferenced. Jordan Folliot in 1295 bore _gules a bend argent_, andRobert de Shaftowe, a contemporary, bore _gules on a bend argent, threemullets azure_.The Shaftos of Tanfield Leigh in this county recorded their pedigree atthe Visitation of 1615. Le Neve continued the family for severalgenerations. James Shafto, aged eight, in 1615 married a sister of SirJohn Jackson of Harraton, and his son was living in 1707, and thendescribed as very poor. His son, again, a third James, married adaughter of Sir Thomas Sandford, and had three sons, after whom thedescent is not clear.The family now resident at Whitworth Park are an early offshoot of theShaftos of Bavington in Northumberland. They have several timesintermarried with the Edens, and, like that family, are very rich inquarterings. Their escutcheon includes the arms of the Cavendishes,Dukes of Newcastle; the Lords Ogle, and many other great houses. Withinthe last century Beamish Park, near Chester-le-Street, has become theseat of another branch of the same family.The Salvins of Croxdale are another of our old historic families whohave held the same acres for generations. They have lived at theirpresent home from the early days of the fifteenth century. In the timeof King Charles they were gallant Loyalists, and two of them were killedin the King’s service.The Whartons have also resided near to Durham for a good many centuries.They descend from the Whartons of Wharton in Westmorland, and theirarmorial insignia is interesting both in its origin and as illustratingthe close alliance often existing between families bearing similar arms.Amongst the Normans who settled in this country after the Conquest was afamily named Flamanville, often abbreviated into Flamville, who tooktheir name from their lordship of that name in the province of La Manchein Normandy, and gave it as a suffix to their new Leicester estate ofAston. Their coat of arms was simply _la manche_, the sleeve, and so thename originally applied to the curious geographical shape of a peninsulacame to be a familiar term in English heraldry. They intermarried withthe Conyers and the Hastings, and both these families adopted the_manche_ as their emblem. An heiress of the latter family married aWharton, and to this day a silver _manche_ or _maunch_ on a black fieldis the Wharton arms.Dr. Wharton of Old Park, a lineal ancestor of the Dryburn family, iscelebrated as one of the courageous physicians who continued to visitthe sick during the Great Plague of London. One of his descendants, Dr.Thomas Wharton, was the friend of the poet Thomas Gray, who visited himat Old Park.The name of Burdon is an old one in the county, and probably derivedfrom one or other of the local villages of that name. There were Burdonsat Helmdon centuries ago, and for a number of generations Burdens haveowned Castle Eden. The curious articles on the family arms, described bysome writers as organ-pipes, are said to be in reality palmers’ staffs,and are so used by the present family.One branch of the Ords, who are a Northumbrian, or more correctly aNorth Durham, family, must not be passed over. In the reign of James I.John Ord acquired property at Fishburn, and founded the house who havefor so long dwelt at Sands Hall, beside Sedgefield.Another family of Northumbrian extraction are the Blenkinsopps ofHoppyland, who are, however, in the male line descended from the Leatonsor Leightons of Benfieldside. Hoppyland was purchased from the Blackettsin 1768 by William Leaton of Gibside, agent to the Bowes family.The Blacketts, who now reside at Wylam in Northumberland, held Hoppylandfor several generations. Their ancestor, Edward Blackett, of Shildon,married for his second wife a daughter of the famous Lilburne family ofThickley-Puncharden, and a near relative of \"Freeborn John.\" The Baronetfamily, who now own the old Conyers estate of Sockburn, are alsodescended from this Edward, and are rather curiously derived from thelatter family. The first baronet’s wife was a daughter of MichaelKirkley of Newcastle, whose wife’s grandmother, Marion Anderson, was alineal descendant of William Conyers of Wynyard.[31]Ravensworth Castle, near Gateshead, has been the home of the Liddellfamily since 1607. The third owner of the name was created a Baronet byKing Charles I. in 1642, and was a strong Royalist during the troubledyears of that King’s reign. Since then the family has twice heldpeerages. Sir Henry Liddell was created Baron Ravensworth in 1747, butas he had no children the title became extinct at his death in 1784.His great-nephew, Sir Thomas Henry Liddell, took the same title on hiselevation to the peerage in 1821.Two members of the Ravensworth family have left names well known in theliterary world. The second Baron, son and namesake of the first, was theauthor of a translation into English lyric verse of the _Odes ofHorace_, and, in conjunction with Mr. Richards, he published in blankverse a translation of the last six books of Virgil’s _Æneid_. He wascreated Earl of Ravensworth, a title that died with his son, when theBarony passed to a cousin. The Very Rev. Henry George Liddell, Dean ofChrist Church, Oxford, and some time Vice-Chancellor of that University,was one of the compilers of the well-known Greek lexicon.The Bowes family was once as widely scattered over Durham as theConyers. Streatlam Castle and Gibside, Bradley Hall, Biddick, andThornton Hall, were all residences of the Boweses at one time. Onebranch only in the male line survives, and is now resident at Croft.Streatlam and Gibside, however, still belong to descendants in thefemale line--the Earls of Strathmore--who have added the name of theirDurham ancestors to the paternal surname of Lyon.One of the most celebrated members of this family was _Old_ Sir WilliamBowes, whose devotion to the young wife he lost, when he was abouttwenty-eight years old, has caused him to be celebrated amongst truelovers. He lived to a great age, and never remarried.A descendant of his, Sir George Bowes, is celebrated in local rhyme as--    \"Cowardy! cowardy! Barney Castle,\"a most erroneous term, for he was, in very truth, a loyal and gallantgentleman, whose brave defence of Barnard Castle in a time of strife andrebellion perhaps saved England for Queen Elizabeth. But the Boweseshave always, like most of our real old families, been a brave old race,and fully up to their motto: _In multis, in magnis, in bonis expertus_.The Chaytors are descended from a certain John Chaytor, of Newcastle,merchant, whose widow remarried William Wilkinson, another merchant inthe same old city.The widow of both made her will on March 23, 1558-59, and in it, afterdesiring to be buried in All Saints’ Church, Newcastle, beside her lastlord, mentions her two sons, Christopher and John, and her daughter,Jane Kirkhouse. John Chaytor the younger married a daughter of JamesPerkinson, and left two children, Elizabeth and John, living in 1579.Christopher Chaytor became an important public man, and, besidesacquiring the Manor of Butterby, near Durham, gathered into the familyfold the great estate of the noble old house of Clervaux, of Croft, andfounded the present Baronet Chaytors. His son Thomas married a daughterof Sir Nicholas Tempest, Bart., of Stella; and his son again, NicholasChaytor, was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Army under the famousfighting Marquess of Newcastle, and by his wife, a Lambton heiress, wasfather of Sir William, created a Baronet in 1671. This baronetcy becameextinct on the death of the first holder in 1720, but was again revivedwhen Sir William Chaytor was created a Baronet in 1801.The Tempests, as already mentioned, were relatives of the Chaytors. Theycame into the county from Yorkshire, when Sir William Tempest, ofStudley, married the heiress of the Washingtons of Washington. Hisnatural son, Rowland, acquired a considerable estate by marrying one ofthe many coheirs of the great baronial family of Umphreville, and wasancestor of the various families of the name seated in this county.Sir Nicholas Tempest, of Stella Hall, in the reign of James I., wascreated a Baronet, and was buried at Ryton in 1625.[Illustration] Portrait of Sir George Bowes(_From the painting at Streatlam Castle_)]His younger brother, Rowland Tempest, was ancestor of the Tempests ofthe Isle and Old Durham, whose representative some hundred years later,John Tempest, who was many years M.P. for the city of Durham, left adaughter Frances, who became eventually heiress of this branch of thefamily. She married the Rev. Sir Henry Vane, Bart., Prebendary of DurhamCathedral, a descendant of the famous Sir Henry Vane the elder, and herson, assuming his mother’s name, became Sir Henry Vane-Tempest. He leftan only daughter, Frances Anne Emily, who married the third Marquess ofLondonderry as his second wife, and was grandmother of the presentMarquess.The Vanes, who descend from a common ancestor with the Earls ofWestmorland, have only been connected with Durham since the reign ofJames I., when Sir Henry Vane, of Hadlo Castle, a Kentish knight,acquired Raby Castle by grant from the Crown. His youngest son wasancestor of the Marquesses of Londonderry, and his eldest son wasancestor of the late Duke of Cleveland and of the present Lord Barnard.The Williamsons came into this county through a strange decree of fate.The estate of Monkwearmouth passed from its purchaser, Colonel GeorgeFenwick, of Brinkburn, the well-known Puritan, to his daughter Dorothy,who married Sir Thomas Williamson, of East Markham, in Nottinghamshire.Sir Thomas belonged to a Cavalier family that had lost much in the Royalcause.Sir William, the fourth Baronet, married a sister of Mrs. Lambton, ofLambton, and co-heiress of John Hedworth, of Harraton, whose wife was adescendant of William James, sometime Bishop of Durham. Whitburn Hallhas for several generations been the family residence, and the presentBaronet is the ninth.Lord Boyne’s family are only recent settlers in Durham, and came herewhen Brancepeth Castle passed to the seventh Viscount upon his marriagewith an heiress of the Russells. They have been Barons of Brancepethsince 1866.Other old families still existent in the shire who should at least bementioned are the Pembertons[32] of Belmont Hall, the Wilkinsons ofDurham, the Fogg-Elliots of Elvet Hill, the Bateses of Wolsingham, theTrotters of Helmdon, and the Hutchinsons.The Claverings of Axwell, a noble old race, have within the last fewyears died out in the male line, but the name and blood continue in thepresent owners of the old home.Descendants of other old families doubtless linger on: Byerleys andFawcetts, Darnells and Croudaces, Muschamps and Emersons, Morgans andMarleys, Ewbankes and Raines, Rippons and Maddisons, and many anotherrace, inheriting to the full the traditions of our country, are to befound scattered up and down the county.INDEXAbbey, Durham, 158---- of Durham dissolved, 16Acre, 107Agnes’s Fast, St., 53Alanshields of Alanshields, 249Aldhun, Bishop, 109\"All Fools’ Day,\" 57Alston, 41Altars at Bolihope, Roman, 80Altar-screen, Durham, 121-122, 138Altar-tomb, Neville, 170---- of Bernard Gilpin, 194, 195Amiatinus, the Codex, 151Anglo-Saxon memorial crosses, 183Arms, Greenwell, 225---- Lumley, 242Associations of John Wesley, Durham, 229-238Asylum, Sunderland Orphan, 35Auckland, brasses in St. Andrew’s, 180, 189---- brass in St. Helen’s, 180, 190Aucklandshire, 39Aycliffe Church, 171Baker, Mrs. Sarah, 194Bale Hill, 218Balliol, Bernard de, 213---- John, sometime King of Scotland, 213Ballads, Robert Surtees’, 65Bank, 105Barbara, Bishop William de St., 30Barnard Castle, 40, 213---- ---- Church, 170, 185Barnes, Mrs. Fridesmond, 189Baronial houses, 239Barons of the Bishopric, 3, 11Barrow at Copt Hill, 182Bateses of Wolsingham, 256Battle of Neville’s Cross, 41Baydale inn, 24Bayley, K.

The Empire, of course, meansthat great medieval constitution of Central Europe corresponding veryroughly indeed to Germany. The German Empire, as we know it, only datesfrom 1870.[2] This important matter, with its bearing upon the Palatinate Power,was first noticed by Mr. K. C. Bayley, _Victoria County History_, ii.137.[3] See Dr. Lapsley’s book, _The County Palatine of Durham_, whichforms a very able survey of the development of the whole system.[4] Dr. Lapsley describes Boldon Book in the _Victoria County Historyof Durham_, vol. i. See also ii. 179.[5] See Dr. Bradshaw’s account of the Black Death and its effect in the_Victoria County History_, ii. 209-222.[6] No account of the legends of Durham would be complete without somenote upon Robert Surtees’ ballads, several of which he foisted upon theunsuspecting Walter Scott as genuine antiques. Perhaps the most weirdand effective is the one generally known as the \"Legend of Sir John leSpring,\" the scene of which is in Houghton, the _alma mater_ of thepoet’s own schoolboy days. One or two of the verses, which are wellknown in the North, run:    \"Pray for the sowle of Sir John-le-Spring,      When the black monks sing--      And the Vesper bells ring;    Pray for the sprite of a murdered Knight,    Pray for the sowle of Sir John-le-Spring.      He fell not, before the....--♰      The waning crescent fled,    When the Martyr’s palm and golden crown      Reward Christ’s soldier dead.    \"He fell not in the battle-field,    Beneath St. George’s banner bright,    When the pealing cry of victory--      Might cheer the sowle of a dying knight;      But at dead of night, in the soft moonlight,    In his garden bower--he lay;      And the dew of sleep, did his eyelids steep    In the arms of his leman gay.    \"And by murderous hand, and bloody brand,        In that guilty bower--        With his paramour,      Did his sowle from his body fleet,    And through mist and mirk, and moonlight gray,    Was forc’d away from the bleeding clay,      To the dreaded judgment seat.\"[7] This is proved by an inquest taken at Hilton in that year. _Cf._Bishop Swaby’s _History of the Hiltons of Hilton Castle_, p. 39.[8] _The River-Names of Europe_, pp. 33, 34.[9] Pudsey commenced to build a Lady Chapel at the east end of thechurch which, as was said, St. Cuthbert shook down.[10] About the year 1800 the whole cathedral underwent a process ofchiselling, in order to render the surface uniform. This was doneunder the superintendence of Wyatt, and in some parts four inches indepth were removed by the operation. The evidence of this is apparentin several places on the north side of the choir and nave, where, inconsequence of the soil having accumulated several feet in height, thatpart of the building has escaped being pared down. What has been theresult is shown there in the nook shafts of the arcade, which have beenreduced from a due proportion to one most inadequate.[11] It is possible that Basire, whose words are rather curious, simplymeans that he destroyed the chapels. He speaks of them as \"being blownup by Sir Arthur Haslerig in the Gunpowder Plot of the late Rebellion.\"[12] Some years before 1834, when Mackenzie wrote, a portion of it hadbeen \"converted into a respectable and substantial house,\" and was thenthe residence of Mr. Henry Morton, Lord Durham’s agent. In or about1875 the house underwent further changes, and has now for many yearsbeen known as Lambton Grange. There is, however, another building inthe Park, locally known as the old Hall, and at one time used as abrewery, which may represent some intermediate residence.[13] The above account of Lambton Castle is abridged from an addressgiven by the late Henry Leighton of Lambton Grange, when acting aschairman at the dinner given to the workmen on the completion of therestoration of Lambton Castle, January 18, 1868.[14] A somewhat similar building is at Bale Hill, near Wolsingham.[15] A considerable portion of the Tower fell in February, 1890,leaving portions of the west and south walls still standing.[16] So Surtees sayeth. _A falcon on a tun_ was the family crest.[17] The tablet in the church which Surtees noted to the memory ofWilliam James has disappeared. There is a large marble tablet on thenorth wall to the memory of James Brack and his three wives, whichreads rather curiously owing to the major portion of the inscriptionshaving been raised and the panel containing his name inserted last. Atthe foot the family arms have been emblazoned, a scarlet shield, havingapparently a passant lion of the same colour on a silver chief, andimpaling the sable shield with the engrailed fess and silver hands ofthe Bates. The colours are badly rubbed and will not survive many morecleanings.[18] The late Mr. Boyle described the house as \"ugly,\" an opinion wecannot agree with. If not beautiful, it is certainly a handsome oldbuilding.[19] The writer of this chapter would be very grateful if any readerwho should chance to know where the other letters are would communicatewith him.[20] See _Dictionary of National Biography_, for Canon Dale, vol.xiii.; for Thomas Pelham Dale, _ibid._, supplement, vol. ii.[21] The descendants of George Dale, the elder brother of Ralph Dale,this Edward Dale’s great grandfather, were apparently extinct inthe male line by 1750, although George Dale, by his marriage withElizabeth, daughter of John Lively, Vicar of Kelloe, 1625-56, had atleast three sons alive in March, 1655-56--namely, Edward, John, andAnthony.[22] See the paper on John Lawrence in vol. iv. of the Proceedings ofthe Sunderland Antiquarian Society.[23] The letter has appeared in a privately printed magazine, the_Family News_. See British Museum catalogue, under \"Periodicals:Northwood.\"[24] See _A Christian Sketch of Lady Maxwell_, by Robert Bourne.London, 1819.[25] When he was in America, he had proposed to and been rejectedby a Miss Hopkey in 1757, and in 1748 he had been engaged to a MissMurray, so that his opinion of the advantage of celibacy had known somevariation.[26] See _Dictionary of National Biography_, vol. ii.[27] Their early pedigree has been printed in detail by the Rev.William Greenwell in the seventh volume of the _New History ofNorthumberland_. Their later descents have been fully dealt with, sofar as Raby and this county are concerned, by Surtees. It thereforeseems needless, in a limited volume like this, to retrace theirfortunes already so well traced. See also an interesting account of thefamily by another local writer in _The House of Neville in Sunshine andShade_.[28] For an interesting note upon the Eures, rather apt to beoverlooked, see the _Archæological Journal_, 1860, p. 218. The familymotto was _Vince malum bono_.[29] Readers interested in the Visitations should read Mr. GeorgeGrazebrooke’s very interesting introduction to the Harleian Society’s_Visitation of Shropshire_, 1623 (vol. xxviii.). Commenting upon asimilar state of affairs in that county, he says: \"Such names shew thatalthough it is very pleasant to a family to find their descents dulyrecorded, still the absence of their name altogether from the list isno proof whatever that their social position and heraldic rights werenot all the time perfectly well assured.\"[30] The origin of the Greenwells may be compared with an interestingpaper upon \"Clerical Celibacy in the Diocese of Carlisle,\" by the Rev.James Wilson, in _Northern Notes and Queries_, 1906, p. 1.[31] Another descent of the Blacketts from the Conyers has been pointedout by the late Mr. Cadwallader Bates. _Cf._ his Letters, p. 124.[32] The Pemberton descent given in Burke’s _Landed Gentry_ needscorrection. _Cf._ Foster’s _Visitations of Durham_, p. 251, footnote 2.Typographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:The Church from the North-west, Finchale Priory 136=> The Church fromthe North-west, Finchale Priory 139 {pg xii}frequently occuring Celtic=> frequently occurring Celtic {pg 87}the orginal chancel=> the original chancel {pg 173}*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MEMORIALS OF OLD DURHAM ***Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in theUnited States without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.
